 # Sri Lanka will be six (06) hours ahead of GMT.
 
+# From Jesper Norgaard Welen (2006-04-14), quoting Sri Lanka News Online
+# <http://news.sinhalaya.com/wmview.php?ArtID=11002> (2006-04-13):
+# 0030 hrs on April 15, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006 +30 minutes)
+# at present, become 2400 hours of April 14, 2006 (midnight of April 14, 2006).
+
+# From Peter Apps and Ranga Sirila of Reuters (2006-04-12) in:
+# <http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=scienceNews&storyID=2006-04-12T172228Z_01_COL295762_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-SRILANKA-TIME-DC.XML>
+# [The Tamil Tigers] never accepted the original 1996 time change and simply
+# kept their clocks set five and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean
+# Time (GMT), in line with neighbor India.
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-18):
+# People who live in regions under Tamil control can use TZ='Asia/Calcutta',
+# as that zone has agreed with the Tamil areas since our cutoff date of 1970.
+
+# From K Sethu (2006-04-25):
+# I think the abbreviation LKT originated from the world of computers at
+# the time of or subsequent to the time zone changes by SL Government
+# twice in 1996 and probably SL Government or its standardization
+# agencies never declared an abbreviation as a national standard.
+#
+# I recollect before the recent change the government annoucemments
+# mentioning it as simply changing Sri Lanka Standard Time or Sri Lanka
+# Time and no mention was made about the abbreviation.
+#
+# If we look at Sri Lanka Department of Government's "Official News
+# Website of Sri Lanka" ... http://www.news.lk/ we can see that they
+# use SLT as abbreviation in time stamp at the beginning of each news
+# item....
+#
+# Within Sri Lanka I think LKT is well known among computer users and
+# adminsitrators.  In my opinion SLT may not be a good choice because the
+# nation's largest telcom / internet operator Sri Lanka Telcom is well
+# known by that abbreviation - simply as SLT (there IP domains are
+# slt.lk and sltnet.lk).
+#
+# But if indeed our government has adopted SLT as standard abbreviation
+# (that we have not known so far) then  it is better that it be used for
+# all computers.
+
+# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-25):
+# One possibility is that we wait for a bit for the dust to settle down
+# and then see what people actually say in practice.

 # From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
 # The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
-# southern coast of Australia, population 10 at last report, along with
-# 50,000 sheep, about 100 kilometers long and 40 kilometers into the
-# continent.  The primary town is Madura, with the other towns being
-# Mundrabilla and Eucla.  According to the sheriff of Madura, the
-# residents got tired of having to change the time so often, as they are
-# located in a strip overlapping the border of South Australia and Western
-# Australia.  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
+# southern coast....  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
 # Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
 # residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
 # much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
 # international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
-# Australia and Western Australia.  As it only affects about 10 people and
-# tourists staying at the Madura Motel, it has never really made as big an
-# impact as Broken Hill.  However, as tourist visiting there or anyone
-# calling the local sheriff will attest, they do keep time in this way.
+# Australia and Western Australia....
 #
 # From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
 # This is confirmed by the section entitled
 # "What's the deal with time zones???" in
-# <http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html>,
-# which says a few other things:
+# <http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html>.
 #
-# * Border Village, SA also is 45 minutes ahead of Perth.
-# * The locals call this time zone "central W.A. Time" (presumably "CWAT").
-# * The locals also call Western Australia time "Perth time".
-#
-# It's not clear from context whether everyone in Western Australia
-# knows of this naming convention, or whether it's just the people in
-# this subregion.
+# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
+# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
+# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
+# coast of the continent.
+#
+# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
+# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
+# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
+# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
+# the largest population centre in this zone....
+#
+# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
+# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
+# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
+# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
+# 
+# (2006-12-09):
+# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
+# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
+# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
+# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.
