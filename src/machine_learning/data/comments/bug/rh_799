Is this reproducible?

The relevant code is:

cachedir = GLib.get_user_cache_dir()
if not os.path.exists(cachedir):
    os.mkdir(cachedir)

Assuming that os.path.exists works as expected and that the directory really existed when os.mkdir got called, this means it got created between the execution of those two line...
Yes.
Also directory is there, and GLib.get_user_cache_dir show this:

In [38]: GLib.get_user_cache_dir()
Out[38]: '/home/ssabchev/.cache'
Just for clarification:

Is the "yes" in comment 4 the answer to the question from comment 3? If so, how to reproduce the problem?

[...]

Considering that $HOME/.cache is a global directory which may be created by other programs, it's subject to race conditions and would benefit from OSError (errno.EEXIST) exception handling.
About clarification: The "yes" is the answer for the question in comment 3.

About .cache - it is a symlink to /tmp/${USERNAME}_cache, may be the problem is somewhere else...

The bluetooth service was stopped, and mask, so after starting it - all is OK.
