Description of problem:
Recently, I filed a bug found by test (BZ#1237213, clone of already fixed RHEL6 bug for RHEL7, actually). The test has TCMS test case linked in External Trackers since the beginning, however when the bug got the 3acks, qe_coverage? flag was added requiring additional action.
IMO bugzilla shall take the External Trackers into account when setting qe_coverage flag and set qe_coverage+ iff there is a test case already linked.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
4.4.9032-3

Additional info:
This can be done in the rules engine, there's no need to modify the bugzilla codebase to do it.

Contact your program manager and ask them to create a rule to do this.
