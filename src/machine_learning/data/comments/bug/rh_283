3.5 Configuring Director
Documentation points to incorrect paths. There is no longer instack.answers.sample file. Instead of this, exists undercloud.conf.sample one.
You're too quick.  The content was barely even there and the docs hadn't been uploaded yet.  The docs are a bit rough, but a combination of the Documents/osp7-beta-issues3.txt and the Documents/director-01jul-html/index.html should be pretty close.

More official docs are in the works.
I've grabbed a bits few minutes after these were added to FTP :)

@Mike, any ETA about documentation release?
The should be there now.  Those references in comment 3 are relative to the ftp site.
