Description of problem:
In rawhide I'm unable to compile caml-crush any more. spatch seems to fail.

Steps to Reproduce:
fedpkg clone caml-crush
cd caml-crush && fedpkg scratch-build


Actual results:
sed -i "s/* int/\* nativeint/g" ./pkcs11.mli
sed -i "s/* int/\* nativeint/g" ./pkcs11.ml
spatch --no-show-diff --in-place --sp-file ./pkcs11_stubs.cocci ./pkcs11_stubs.c
There is no standard.iso in /builddir/build/BUILD/caml-crush-1.0.6/src/bindings-pkcs11.
Are you sure you run a properly installed version of spatch ?\nNo 'spatch' nor 'spatch.opt' found in /builddir/build/BUILD/caml-crush-1.0.6/src/bindings-pkcs11
Makefile:24: recipe for target 'idl' failed


Expected results: (results from f22)
sed -i "s/* int/\* nativeint/g" ./pkcs11.mli
sed -i "s/* int/\* nativeint/g" ./pkcs11.ml
spatch --no-show-diff --in-place --sp-file ./pkcs11_stubs.cocci ./pkcs11_stubs.c
init_defs_builtins: /usr/share/coccinelle/standard.h
What is the full output?  In particular which versions of which
packages do you have installed?
The output is from mockbuild. The failed build logs are available at:
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=10189514

According to that, coccinelle-1.0.1-1.fc23 was used.
Can you try this version:
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=10190618
coccinelle-1.0.1-3.fc23
That works, thanks.
