Description of problem:

Starting a Fedora 22 64-bit (AArch64) guest on a Fedora 22 AMD Seattle 64-bit host fails when using KVM.  

  -cpu host -machine virt,accel=kvm

The same image starts and runs successfully when using TCG.

  -M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -machine accel=tcg


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

kernel-4.0.4-301.fc22.aarch64


How reproducible:

consistently


Steps to Reproduce:
1.  On a Fedora 22 AMD Seattle host, attempt to start QEMU using an F22 AArch64 image with KVM, i.e.,:

qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -nodefconfig \
    -nodefaults \
    -display none \
    -m 2048 \
    -cpu host -machine virt,accel=kvm \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=/usr/share/edk2.git/aarch64/QEMU_EFI-pflash.raw,readonly=on \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=fedora-22-aarch64-nvram \
    -device virtio-scsi-device,id=scsi \
    -drive file=fedora-22.img,format=raw,if=none,id=hd0 -device scsi-hd,drive=hd0 \
    -netdev user,id=usernet -device virtio-net-device,netdev=usernet \
    -serial stdio


Actual results:

Fails to boot (see attached log).


Expected results:

Boots without error.

This bug vanished. Updating the kernel made it go away, so I wanted to see which exact commit(s). There wasn't anything obvious, so at some point I decided to confirm the bug was still hitting 100% with 4.0.4-301.fc22.aarch64, but it no longer ever hits. Since the bug was hitting in UEFI I tried a fresh varstore, but still can't get it to reproduce.

So, I don't know what it was, or where it went, but I'm going to close this bug now. We can reopen when/if it reproduces.
