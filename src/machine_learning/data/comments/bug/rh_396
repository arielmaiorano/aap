Description: 

View any blob, tree, commit, or tag in the repository with :Gedit (and :Gsplit, :Gvsplit, :Gtabedit, ...). Edit a file in the index and write to it to stage the changes. Use :Gdiff to bring up the staged version of the file side by side with the working tree version and use Vim's diff handling capabilities to stage a subset of the file's changes.

Oops, it looks like vim-fugitive is already packaged for Fedora:

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=662169

I guess we should re-use the existing package then.  You can ask the maintainer to grant you the co-maintainer access if you want to help with maintaining the package:
