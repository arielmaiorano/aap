Description: 
Python module for native access to the systemd facilities.
Functionality includes sending of structured messages to the journal
and reading journal files, querying machine and boot identifiers and a
lists of message identifiers provided by systemd. Other functionality
provided by libsystemd is also wrapped.

This module was part of systemd upstream and is being split out to make systemd itself a bit leaner. python-systemd replaces systemd-python and python3-systemd replaces systemd-python3. No functional change expected.
It may be worth to include in package systemd/docs, but that is just my wish.

Thanks! Docs are next on my TODO list. They will require a bit of cleaning up after the detachment from the rest of systemd.
