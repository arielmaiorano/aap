gnome-bluetooth-3.16.1-1.fc22.x86_64
bluez-cups-5.29-2.fc22.x86_64


How reproducible:
Always


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open control center, click on Bluetooth icon
2.
3.

Actual results:

Blank, see screenshot

Expected results:

I should be able to do something in here, like browse for bluetooth devices and configure them to use with GNOME.

Additional info:

When I first enter the panel, it's completely blank, unlike the attached screen shot. As soon as I click another window (Terminal, to take the screen shot), then the words "Devices" and "Visible as "Foobar"" appear, but I still can't do anything in here at all.
No point in tracking the same bug in two different places, closing.
