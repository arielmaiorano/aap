trivial fix

Description of problem: Scripts in ~/.config/plasma-workspace/shutdown/ and /etc/kde/shutdown/ are not executed on logout.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
plasma-workspace-5.3.1-2.fc22.x86_64

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. $ printf "#/bin/bash\ntouch /tmp/oops\n" > ~/.config/plasma-workspace/shutdown/oops.sh
2. $ chmod +x ~/.config/plasma-workspace/shutdown/oops.sh
3. logout from the kde session

Actual results:
There is no /tmp/oops file, because the script was not executed.

Expected results:
Existing /tmp/oops file.

Additional info:
Patch attached.
/etc/kde/shutdown isn't used anymore regardless.

Use
/etc/xdg/plasma-workspace/shutdown
instead

but otherwise, the patch looks like the right approach, I'll take a closer look today.
