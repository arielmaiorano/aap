This patch [1] for bug 1221614 introduces a problem on el7 by changing from use of the global configuration object to self.configuration for the iscsi_helper option.  This causes the default option of 'tgtadm' to be used rather than 'lioadm' from cinder-dist.conf.

Rather than fixing this with another patch for RHOS5-el7, the proposal is to change the default iscsi_helper option for the el7 branch to the desired option, which gives the desired behavior.

'tgtadm' is not functional/supported on el7 so there is not a risk of breaking anyone relying on that current default.

This problem was introduced from an in-flight patch for bug 1221868.  Will complete this fix on that BZ.
