Description of problem:

Please put following line to selinux-policy spec file:

    Obsoletes: openscap-selinux

We have dropped openscap-selinux as a resulution of bug 1209969. However we cannot easily put the upper mentioned line to the openscap.spec. That is because
OpenSCAP base package is arch and as such it cannot easily obsolete noarch package. (See bug 1028706 for more info).
I think you could add obsoletes to the openscap-scanner. This package is not multilib so there should be no dependency conflict.
Ok, you are right. I have put the 'Obsoletes:' and rebuild the package as openscap-1.2.5-1.

I will mark this as a dupe to bug 1209969.
