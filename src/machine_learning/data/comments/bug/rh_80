Problem still exists, not fixed for me by firefox-39.0-7.fc22.x86_64

I deleted tried to delete ~/.mozilla but no change.
I am having the opposite problem with 39.0.6.
My preferene is set for restoring the previous session and it does not.
Restore from history works.

39.0-7 doesn't seems to solves the bug.

Each time I launch FF (configured to displayed by home page), it display the "restore session after crash" page.
Notice: I can reproduce this issue using a fresh new profile (firefox-39.0-7.fc21)

Firefox-39.0-7.fc22 does not solve this problem for me.
I see. Thanks for the feedback.
This bug seems to be cause by a Fedora specific patch. Still investigating.
I set firefox to always show the profile manager before starting.
With the update to 39.0 I noticed that I get the profile manager twice every time I start firefox. It does not apply to all profiles though.

 - Conclusion -

While it runs indirectly - via script ("This script is meant to run a mozilla program from the mozilla rpm installation"):
$ /usr/bin/firefox

it'll go: "We're Sorry" Firefox had a problem and crashed. ... routine.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In contrast to "script mode", while it runs directly:
$ /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox-bin

no problemos whatsoever.

Good catch! It's caused by "firefox -remote 'ping()'" command which crashes and then (in regular FF launch) Firefox takes this crash as normal FF crash and tries to restore the session.
I commented on the entire "MOZILLA_DOWN" section, so far works OK.
Gonna emerge some defect, we will see.

BTW take a look at this paragraph, if you haven't already
