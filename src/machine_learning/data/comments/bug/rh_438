When trying to use mock to debug a build failure with the following any of the commands run after the first fail.

eg if I try a build that fails and then try to get into the non cleaned up chroot to debug with the following two commands I get the following crash:

/usr/bin/mock -r fedora-rawhide-aarch64 --yum --rebuild --no-cleanup-after blah.src.rpm

/usr/bin/mock -r fedora-rawhide-aarch64 --yum --no-cleanup-after --shell

This is already fixed in mock-1.2.10
