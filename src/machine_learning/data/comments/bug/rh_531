Proposed patch for jffi requiring jffi-native via the OSGi manifest

Description of problem:

There needs to be a Require-Bundle attribute in jffi.jar's MANIFEST.MF so it requires com.kejai.jffi.native.  The native jar needs to add a Bundle-Version to it's MANIFEST.MF.  This allows the Eclipse docker plug-ins to bring in the native jar.
Jeff, please provide patches against HEAD aka pull before commit.
Rebased patch pushed and built.
