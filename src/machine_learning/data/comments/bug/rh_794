+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1233258 +++

Description of problem:

When a fop starts a subfop as part of its own execution, it's possible that this subfop finishes before the manager has completed the processing of the current state. In this case ec_resume() is called and a new instance of the same state machine is executed by another thread.

This could cause multiple problems.
