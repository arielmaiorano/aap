If IPv6 autoconf is active on an interface and the autoconfprivacy extension is used,
redundant addresses are added whenever an autoconfprivacy address expires.
The autoconfprivacy extension is used by default and can be disabled with ifconfig(8)
as a workaround:
<pre>
# ifconfig em0 -autoconfprivacy
</pre>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
