Description of problem:
With util-linux before 2.26, renaming a file to overwrite an existing file worked. With util-linux 2.26 it stopped working, and does not print an error message, just skips.

$ mkdir a
$ touch b a/b
$ rename -v a/ . a/b

With 2.26 there is not output, return value is 4. With 2.25 the output is 
`a/b' -> `.b'.

This change in behaviour is unexpected. It seems to be in contradiction to the man page too, which says that files will be overwritten without warning.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
util-linux-2.26.2-1.fc22.x86_64
Oh, it is not related to the target existing. Pattern seems to have stopped working for directory names instead. Feel free to close if this is on purpose.
Yes, the change is probably related to the commit:

https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/bd9ced628bb8621babc1d677669c14277845745d

... the patch forces rename to really work with filenames rather than with full paths. And yes, it's a little bit controversial.
