Description of problem:

Glusterd from the 3.7 fedora repository does not start up.

It's in a minimal fedora 22 docker container, but it doesn't look like that's the problem.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

glusterfs-server-3.7.2-3.fc22.x86_64


How reproducible:

Always


Steps to Reproduce:

> glusterd --debug
USAGE: /usr/sbin/glusterd [options] [mountpoint]


Actual results:

USAGE: /usr/sbin/glusterd [options] [mountpoint]

Expected results:
much debug output

Additional info:
Does not happen with glusterd from the 3.6 repository.
That happened, because there was nothing in /etc/glusterfs. RaSTar from irc said that it's because of /etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol.
