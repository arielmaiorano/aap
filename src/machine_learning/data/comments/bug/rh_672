login window with troubling gnome3

Description of problem:
I cant remove gnome3 or its login no matter what.Ive tried to respin and the kde+mate spin that I have still has gnome3.I did not use anything to install GNOME3 with.Having lightdm installed to bypass gnome3 and gdm doesnt work either.I have lightdm installed and I get dropped to a login prompt instead of x login window. I get massive 'OH NO. Something went wrong' dialogs when trying to get lightdm loaded for MATE/KDE sessions.The 'OH-NO dialog' is from GNOME3.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
22, possibly 21 also

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install or build from livecd.
1. boot livecd(option is still there)
1. update with fedup from fc21.

Actual results:
"OH NO. Something went wrong."

Expected results:
typical login with lightdm. There should be no GDM/GNOME3 login option as related packages were removed or never installed to begin with.MATE has its own packages and libs and doesnt touch the GNOME3 ones.

Additional info:

Spin creation problems aren't a bug, getting a custom live iso working can be a complicated process and the best thing to do is start with an existing spin kickstart and modify it.

Try asking on the livecd mailing list (https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/livecd) and have a copy of the kickstart you are using available someplace that people can look at.
