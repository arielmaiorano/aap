The pcvt(4) console driver has a bug that can cause some keyboard
controllers to lock up when a key is pressed that toggles the status
of a keyboard LED (scroll lock, caps lock, etc).  The problem is
generally intermittent and the keyboard can be "unlocked" by unplugging
and plugging it back in.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
