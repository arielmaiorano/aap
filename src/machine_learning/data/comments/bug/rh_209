Actual results:
Server responded with an error: 'uReport data is invalid.'

I have valid bugzilla cookie. Folder attached. coredump is not attached, as far as it has more than 500M.
Thank you for taking time to report this bug!
It was caused by too strict validation of one of the uReport items on the server and should be fixed now.
