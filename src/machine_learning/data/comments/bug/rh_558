Description of problem:
After installing python-rdomanager-oscplugin we run the command "openstack undercloud install" to install the undercloud. The command doesn't show any output, which makes it seem like it is not working at all, and it is very tempting to terminate it. Please provide some progress report or output to the user.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
python-rdomanager-oscplugin-0.0.8-4.el7ost.noarch


How reproducible:
100%


Additional info:
It looks like this: 

[stack@instack ~]$ openstack undercloud install
There is also no logging at all to .instack/ - this should be fixed in the next puddle.
