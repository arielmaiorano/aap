A previously working dnf, on `dnf update`, produced the following traceback after listing upgraded packages:

I should add that `yum update` is working as expected.

Hello Robbie,
thank you for the feedback.

Unfortunately this issue isn't easy to solve. Clearly, there is a bug in dnf-plugins-extras-tracer plugin which causes this traceback. The bug was fixed long time ago, but it is not possible to build the new release for F21 because of dependency on new DNF.

It is not that convenient, but `tracer` command works just fine - only the dnf plugin is bugged, so you still can run it manually. Also, the plugin is working on F22.

My apologies
