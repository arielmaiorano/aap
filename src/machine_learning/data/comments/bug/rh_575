We have meet this problem in following certs:
https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1233910
https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1227582

In both cert, vendor want to created RHEL7 supplement cert, but actually RHEL6 created.
The RHEL version of supplemental cert is RHEL6, but it shows RHEL7 in its hardware spec entry.

Hardware spec entry :https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1096421
Supplemental cert: https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1234719
I fixed it and it will include in 5.5-21 release.
