Description of problem:

Doing a dnf upgrade in Rawhide:

  Upgrading   : perl-XML-SAX-0.99-15.fc23.noarch                        259/674 
/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.v3p4sv: line 1: 37797 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) perl -MXML::SAX -e "XML::SAX->add_parser(q($p))->save_parsers()" 2> /dev/null
/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.v3p4sv: line 1: 37801 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) perl -MXML::SAX -e "XML::SAX->add_parser(q($p))->save_parsers()" 2> /dev/null

systemd grabbed the core dump.  However it doesn't appear to
correspond to the current version of perl -- possibly it
coredumped with the previous version of perl and then perl
was upgraded.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

perl-XML-SAX-0.99-15.fc23.noarch

How reproducible:

Unknown.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. dnf upgrade in Rawhide.
Created attachment 1042718
core1

Attaching the coredump in case it is useful.
Created attachment 1042719
core2
