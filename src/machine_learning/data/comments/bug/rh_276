startx file

I have over 60+ .serverauth.XXXX files in my home folder, as far I know, startx should remove those files.

this is my bashrc script to login

[[ -z $DISPLAY && $XDG_VTNR -eq 1 ]] && exec /usr/bin/startx

and .xinitrc

exec 	cinnamon-session
Hi,

I just checked and the startx script has this:

    trap "rm -f '$xserverauthfile'" HUP INT QUIT ILL TRAP KILL BUS TERM

And after running xinit it does:

    if [ x"$xserverauthfile" != x ]; then
        rm -f "$xserverauthfile"
    fi

So it should always cleanup after itself, and I've just run "startx" and then exited my desktop normally and it did indeed cleanup after itself.

The only scenario where it will leave a .serverauth around is when you kill -9 it, and there is nothing we can do about this.

Regards,

Hans
