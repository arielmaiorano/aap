Description of problem:
Please consider adding blacklisting into the rpmgrill. I had already
written the corresponding patch which:

Adds "--blacklist" option which provides a blacklist file
to the rpmgrill in format:

# COMMENT
# BuildLog module  
MacroExpansion
MakeError
...
    
where each blacklisted test case is on a separate line.
Found issues in test cases specified in blacklist file will
not be reported by rpmgrill.
