I decided to rebase to the latest upstream release, which built for me locally. A 'fedpkg build' in rawhide is now failing to find the pthread library, which is strange because it should be part of glibc.

OK. I found and fixed the problem with pthread library in latest upstream release, but the original problem where is fails the gu_hash_test is still present. I am leaning towards excluding arm builds until this is fixed.
I've disabled ARM builds for galera in rawhide to get past this. Bug for ExcludeArch is here:
