Section Number and Name: 
18.1

Describe the issue: 
Step 1 warns that enough space must be available for the backup. But it fails to specify where. Also, is kattelo-backup able to specify a target location? Where is the online backup option? How to backup a capsule? Is it needed?

Suggestions for improvement: 
Describe the missing pieces

Additional information: 
Given the time a full backup takes, customer could opt for doing a online backup of the DB's and snapshot the filesystem for the pulp content (if the OS or hypervisor supports it).
Since this issue was entered in Red Hat Bugzilla, the release flag has been
set to ? to ensure that it is properly evaluated for this release.
So the docs say:


 Run the backup script:

# /usr/bin/katello-backup


However this is incorrect, it should be:

 Run the backup script:

# /usr/bin/katello-backup /path/to/backup/location

where /path/to/backup/location is a valid path and has enough space.
