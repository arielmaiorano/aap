Description of problem:

        if (gf_uuid_compare (stbuf.ia_gfid, tmp_loc.inode->gfid)) {
		gf_msg (this->name, GF_LOG_ERROR, 0,
                        DHT_MSG_GFID_MISMATCH,
		        "%s: gfid different on the target file on %s",
                        tmp_loc.path, dst_node->name);
                ret = -1;
		local->op_errno = EIO;
                goto out;
	}

        dst_node = dht_subvol_get_cached (this, tmp_loc.inode);

dst_node->name is accessed in the log, but dst_node is assigned later on.
