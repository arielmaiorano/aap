screenshot, all new windows always look like this

Description of problem: After checking "show hidden files" this setting is sticky and can't be reverted. When I uncheck "show hidden files" it works for the current window only, when I close that window and click on Files again, the new window shows hidden files again.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
nautilus-3.16.2-1.fc22.x86_64

How reproducible:
Aways


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activities > Files
2. Click the 2nd icon in the upper right corner, and check Show Hidden Files.
3. Close the files window.
4. Click Activities > Files. It comes up with hidden files shown. This is expected.
5. Click the 2nd icon in the upper right corner, uncheck "Show Hidden Files". Hidden files are now not shown. This is also expected.
6. Close the window.
7. Activities > Files

Actual results:

This window shows hidden files, and "Show Hidden Files" is checked even though I've previously unchecked it. 

So new windows now always have hidden files shown and I have no way in the GUI to make hidden files no longer shown.

Expected results:

Once I uncheck "Show Hidden Files" this should stick for future newly opened windows.

Additional info:
User error! Updated the upstream bug.
