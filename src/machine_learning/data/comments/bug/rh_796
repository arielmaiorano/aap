Description:
The Log::Agent Perl module provides an abstract layer for logging and tracing,
which is independent from the actual method used to physically perform those
activities. It acts as an agent (hence the name) that collects the requests
and delegates processing to a logging driver.

Package the README file as %doc rather then %license.  The %license macro is reserved for license texts so they get installed even if documentation is disabled.  This README file doesn't provide, from the licensing point of view,  anything what the RPM License tag or the modules themselves don't.

Consider packaging Log-Agent-Rotate for the optional log rotating features.

The following build-time deps aren't needed since the files requiring them aren't tested:
 - Mail::Mailer
 - Sys::Syslog

The patch is fine.

So is the license.
Updated spec file is on the same address.
I cannot package the Log-Agent-Rotate because it's Artistic 1 only code.

Ack, all good.
