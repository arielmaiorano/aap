Description of problem:
See Steps to Reproduce and Actual results.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gnome-shell-3.16.2-1.fc22.x86_64
emacs-24.5-2.fc22.x86_64


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Fedora 22 Workstation and emacs
2. Start emacs (either from Activities or even command line)
3. Go to Activities and observe
   - or -
   Press Alt-tab and observe

Actual results:
In both cases, the icon caption says "Emacs Client" when in fact I'm running just emacs.


Expected results:
Icon is correctly captioned as "Emacs".


Additional info:
It seems like gnome-shell is confused about the fact that there are both emacs.desktop and emacsclient.desktop present in /usr/share/applications/, and they both have Icon=emacs.

No, we don't look at the icon to figure out the corresponding application. The most important bit is the WM_CLASS set on the window, what does running "xprop | grep WM_CLASS" in a terminal print out?
$ xprop | grep WM_CLASS
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "emacs", "Emacs"

$ xprop | grep Emacs
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "emacs", "Emacs"

No sign of "Emacs Client" here.
OK, so I figured out the culprit: One of the first steps we do when trying to match a window to an application is to look for a .desktop file that contains a StartupWMClass that matches the window's WM_CLASS. In this case, this is true for both emacs.desktop and emacsclient.desktop and we end up picking a "random" one. I've filed an upstream bug with a patch, let's track the issue there.
If you want to apply a workaround until the issue is properly fixed, you can copy emacsclient.desktop into $HOME/.local/share/applications and change the StartupWMClass key to something else (for instance 'EmacsClient').
That was quick, thank you!
