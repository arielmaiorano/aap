Description of problem:
From logs in nova-scheduler it seems that we don't filter nodes based on DiskFilter. Therefore it happened multiple times that we miss-match required HW for storage or other roles.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
2015-07-02.1 Puddle

Steps to Reproduce:
1. deploy overcloud
2. check nova-scheduler log for filters

Actual results:
DiskFiler is missing from the list

Expected results:
We filter hosts based on Disk attribute as well

The advanced matching is handled with ahc-tools.  Profiles are created and matched to flavors using ahc-tools
This is definitely a bug. AHC is advanced filtering -- not installed by default. And I already was debugging two issues, where people were complaining that their compute nodes ended up on storage dedicated nodes and that our filtering doesn't work.

Furthermore in basic flow we instruct people to create nova flavors with certain disk size and then we are not filtering on them.
