Error: Corrupted compiled interface

Makefile:5447: recipe for target 'src/daemon/common/commonOptions.cmo' failed

This usually indicates that parallel builds are enabled, and
one compile has half-overwritten another compile of the target
file (date.cmi).

I will try a rebuild soon to see if that fixes it.
Looks like it was just a race in a Makefile somewhere.  In any case,
it rebuilds now without any change.

Thanks for the rebuild.
