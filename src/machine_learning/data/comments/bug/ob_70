On some machines, a PCIBIOS device driver interrupt allocation bug can cause a
kernel hang while probing PCI devices.  If you have this symptom, you can disable
PCIBIOS as a workaround.  To do this,
    <ul>
    <li>Enter the User Kernel Configuration by booting with the
	option &quot;boot -c&quot;.
    <li>Once at the <i>UKC></i> prompt, enter <pre><tt>
	UKC> disable pcibios
	UKC> quit
    </tt></pre>
    <li>See <a href="./faq/faq5.html#5.6">FAQ 5.6</a> after a successful
    boot for instructions on how to re-write your kernel to disable PCIBIOS
    permanently.
    </ul>
