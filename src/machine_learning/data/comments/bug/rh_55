Description of problem:
When Upgrading CloudForms to a new version, the RedHat and ManageIQ data stores are not automatically upgraded. A customer has to reset the datastore to make the new upgraded Automate model available.

Neither the release notes nor the upgrade document mention this fact.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
5.4

How reproducible:
always during upgrade

Steps to Reproduce:
1. follow the upgrade instructions here:
https://access.redhat.com/articles/1435433

Actual results:
It should be mentioned that after the upgrade the administrator has to navigate to "Automate, Expoert/Import" and then click on "Reset "Reset all Datastore custom classes and instances to default"
Greg, is this correct?  Are there caveats?
That is correct.  Since they are running commands on the appliance you could run "rake evm:automate:reset" instead of doing it from the UI.

The automate changes are required to support new features and enhancements.  For example in the last release there were enhancements to retirement and new features like orchestration, foreman and SCVMM.
Christian, I just added the steps to the migration articles, can you please review them before I close this?

Thanks,

Perfect, IMHO the ticket can be closed.

Thanks,
Christian
