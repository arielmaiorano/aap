perl-URI-Find-20140709-4.fc23 fails to build in F23 because test fail because the package does not declare build-time dependency on `perl(open)':

+ ./Build test
Can't locate open.pm in @INC (you may need to install the open module) (@INC contains: /builddir/build/BUILD/URI-Find-20140709/blib/lib /builddir/build/BUILD/URI-Find-20140709/blib/arch /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 .) at t/Find.t line 5.

Dubious, test returned 2 (wstat 512, 0x200)
No subtests run
I also removed the tests sub-package because I believe nobody cares about them today. If you mind, just revert the 9d971a843734ce3c27ab4fd100fbabba6f365d1d commit.
