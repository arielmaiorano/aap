Description of problem:

If you have the dnf 'local' plugin installed, using dnf to upgrade
installed RPMs with local (on-disk) RPMs causes dnf to install the
packages but exit uncleanly with a Python exception trace.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

dnf-1.0.1-2.fc22.noarch
python-dnf-plugins-extras-local-0.0.8-1.fc22.noarch

How reproducible:
For me, 100%.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the dnf local plugin
2. Build local versions of some RPM(s) that you have installed
3. Run 'dnf update yours.rpm'
4. Watch the Python exception at the end of dnf's execution

Actual results:

# dnf update choqok*-1.5-*
Failed to synchronize cache for repo '_local' from 'file:///var/lib/dnf/plugins/local': Cannot download repomd.xml: Cannot download repodata
/repomd.xml: All mirrors were tried, disabling.

    return self.base.repos[self.reponame]
KeyError: u'@commandline'

Expected results:

No Python exception backtrace and dnf does whatever it's skipping here.

Additional info:

I assume that this happening because dnf is mocking up a fake
'@commandline' repo name that does not actually exist in self.base.repos
and the local plugin is not prepared to deal with this.
