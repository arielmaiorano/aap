This works fine for me in 
Firefox 34 in Fedora 19 (Obviously my versions are older than yours)
Chrome 42 in Fedora 19.

Can you please give me more information so I can reproduce this bug in my test box:
1. What kind of errata you selected - both applicable or one applicable/one installable or both installable?
2. The content hosts use the same cv or different cvs?
3. Did you see any js error or anything in browser dev console?
4. Can you please add foreman-debug?
