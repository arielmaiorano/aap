Client side ident protocol was broken in libwrap, affecting anything using libwrap including <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tcpd&amp;sektion=8">tcpd</a>. The effect of this was that libwrap would never retrieve and log ident values from remote hosts on connections.<br>
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/020_libwrap.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
