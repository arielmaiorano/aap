+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1175220 +++

Description of problem:
Guest could be booted if we specify rhel7.1 new feature with -M RHEL6.x on rhel7.1 host. Consequences might have 
1. From end user pov, boot successfully means we support it, however, we do not fully support new features under older machine type.

2. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1175099 and Bug 1172643 - migration/pci-bridge: 7.1rhev->7.0 fails

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
qemu-kvm-1.5.3-84.el7

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot guest with pci bridge or ovmf with -M rhel6.x on rhel7.1 host
2.
3.

Actual results:
Guest could be booted successfully but migration fail 

Expected results:
Guest should not be booted if we specify the devices we do not plan to support with -M

PCI bridges were tech preview, so there's no problem in not supporting migration.  AHCI will probably be the same when we start supporting Q35 fully.

For OVMF probably the bug should not be closed, but just deferred to 7.2.  Please clone bug 1175099 for qemu-kvm.

In any case, QE is already opening bug when they find new stuff not working on old machine types.  Changing this to a tracker.

Hai,

I think there is a misunderstanding here, concerning Paolo's remark in bug 1175220 comment 1, also visible in comment 0 in this BZ:

In the above Paolo meant that support for OVMF should be expressly denied by QEMU in *both* qemu-kvm and qemu-kvm-rhev, if a too old machine type is selected.

This has been resolved already, in bug 1175099 for qemu-kvm-rhev, and in bug 1176283 for qemu-kvm.

For the OVMF component there is nothing to do. I'm closing this as NOTABUG. Please reopen if I misunderstood something. Thanks!
