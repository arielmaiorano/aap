Description of problem:
I whould like to Install ClamAV and Configure Daily Scanning on CentOS and follows this tutorial: 

https://www.centosblog.com/how-to-install-clamav-and-configure-daily-scanning-on-centos/

but yum canÂ´ t find clamd


How reproducible:every time


Steps to Reproduce:
1.get terminal as Root
2.run yum install clamav clamd
3.you see  that clamd is not found in epel


Additional info:
May I make you aware that the linked instructions are for CentOS 5 and 6,
while you are reporting for 7? However the ClamAV packages are anyway for
EPEL 7 available - but named differently. A command that works across all
EPEL-enabled systems is:

  yum install /usr/sbin/clamd /usr/bin/clamscan

Nevertheless the different naming of packages is not a bug, thus closing.
