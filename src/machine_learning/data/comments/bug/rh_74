Using the `fedora:22` docker image, installing `dpkg-dev` doesn't install tar or find. Thus, running dpkg-scanpackages fails.
so we need add 

BuildRequires: /usr/bin/tar /usr/bin/find 

on package dpkg-dev ? 

That is what you asking for ? 

what dpkg are you using dpkg-1.17.25 or dpkg-1.16.16   ?
The packaging guidelines indicate that find and tar should not be included in dependencies as they are bound to be available on any fedora distro.

Docker is not a distro it is something you build by yourself, so you will need to add those packages to your docker setup.
I've also tested using the official docker image (https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/docker.html) as a base image, which doesn't have find or tar.
Could you reassign this bug report to docker please , I'm short of time, right now .

Thanks,
Hi, Docker Maintainers

Should docker setup added find or tar ?
This is not really a docker package issue, but a docker fedora image.
Hi Tom, please ping fedora rel-eng or file a ticket on their trac for issues with the fedora image
