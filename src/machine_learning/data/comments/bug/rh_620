Description of problem:

External USB audio device stop working with system configuration. 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

Attached alsa-info.sh output

How reproducible:

Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. access audio configuration page and try to chose external usb audio
2.
3.

Actual results:

External usb audio device is listed on Input and Audio tabs, but audio always comes out from Built in speakers.

Expected results:

Audio from USB device

Additional info:

Device device definitely works because if I configure linphone application to use directly the USB device, audio gets correctly sent there. What is no longer working is integration with system configuration.

I actually fixed my problem running these commands as my non root user:

pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start


still working after a reboot. 

Still not sure what happened, but this is now resolved for me.
ok, closing as requested
