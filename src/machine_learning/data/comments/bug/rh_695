Description of problem:
I guess this is a spelling mistake.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.17.1-14.fc22.x86_64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. man Xwrapper.config

Actual results:
"and auto to letter the wrapper auto-detect."

Expected results:
"and auto to let the wrapper auto-detect."

Additional info:
There is no 'xorg-x11-server-Xorg' package in the component list. Hence I am using the component 'xorg-x11-server'.
Hi,

Thanks for the bug report, I've send a patch upstream fixing this. For Fedora I believe it is best to wait for the fix to trickle down from upstream.

Regards,

Hans
