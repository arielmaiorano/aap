/etc/xdg/QtProject/qtlogging.ini is a KDE specific logging configuration for QDebug. However in the current setup it forces all other non-KDE applications to not print any debugging output. This happens no matter whether the system Qt is used or your own Qt deployment (as in my own case - developing Qt itself).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile an arbitrary Qt (non-KDE) application with qDebug()
2. Run app
3. Observe the console output
Actual Results:  
No QDebug output is printed to the console
It not KDE specific.

It's a distro-wide policy decision that our optimized Release builds of Qt should not enable debug logging by default.

You're free to override that by using a customized ~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini or modify /etc/xdg/QtProject/qtlogging.ini as you see fit.
Well, you're right that this affects *all* installed copies of Qt, not just our packaged versions.

I figured using a global qtlogging.ini was easier than patching Qt though.

Suggestions welcome.
As Rex Dieter explained, this is a Fedora policy decision, not a KDE one. qt-settings just happens to be a subpackage of the kde-settings SRPM in Fedora, for historical and convenience reasons. But all those *-settings are Fedora settings and do not come from KDE upstream.
