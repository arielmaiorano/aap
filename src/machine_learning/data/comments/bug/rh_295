Description of problem:
By default the $EDITOR environment variable is set to "emacs".  Emacs is not installed by default.
This means that the shell hotkey "Ctrl-x Ctrl-e" to open the commandline in the default editor does not work.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):


How reproducible:
Can be reproduced on a fresh install of RHEL 7.0

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to shell
2. Press Ctrl-x Ctrl-e to try to open the commandline in the default $EDITOR
3. Error is displayed 

Actual results:
-bash: emacs: command not found

Expected results:
It should open in a default editor that is installed by default.  Either vim or nano or pico or whichever is preffered as a default editor by the Red Hat project.

Additional info:
Tested in the RHEL 7.0 image available on AWS.

I'm not sure exactly which component this bug report should be filed under so have chosen bash for now.  Please assign it to a more appropriate component if necessary.
Hey Aaron, if you could find out where in your system the environtment is set
or if you could attach the output of:
bash -v -l -c 'exit'

...that would really help me.
On second though, and second peek in the bash manpage, I've decided to close this.
Bash's order of resolution in your case (C-x C-e) is $VISUAL, $EDITOR and emacs, so not having them set would not solve your issue anyway.
