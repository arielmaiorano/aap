Description of problem:
This package does not include a dist tag (e.g. '.fc23') in its release field, even though it is mandatory according the packaging guidelines:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:DistTag

Our automated testing efforts are beginning to rely on having a dist tag in RPM file names:
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/packaging/2015-June/thread.html#10693

Please adjust the package spec file and add '%{?dist}' at the end of the release field. Do this for all supported Fedora releases.

It is not necessary to build a new package version immediately, but it should be prepared in the spec file so that a new package build in the future will contain the dist tag.

Thank you.

Thank you. Could you please also adjust the spec file for f21 and f22 branches? You don't need to create a new build, this is just to make sure it won't get forgotten once we need one.
I don't intend to. Considering the nature of this package it's almost certain that no updates to it will be shipped to < F-23 and I don't like the suggested "just in case" stray commits myself.
In that case I'm closing the bug again.
