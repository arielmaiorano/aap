Description of problem:


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gfortran/gcc 4.8.3

How reproducible:
compile code, error happens

Steps to Reproduce:
1. compile these two files (needs module file from 1. file for second file to compile)
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szaghi/FLAP/master/src/IR_Precision.F90
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szaghi/FLAP/master/src/Data_Type_Command_Line_Interface.F90
2. internal compiler error occurs

Actual results:
internal compiler error

Expected results:
successful compilation
This got fixed with r208386 aka PR51976.  As this revision is adding a new feature and this ICE is error-recovery, we're not going to backport such a patch.  DTS-3 contains GCC 4.9 and there the issue is fixed.
Sounds great. Noob question: what is DTS? 

Is there more generally an official way of installing newer gcc versionas, e.g. in /opt/gcc/5.1 (or similar)?

DTS (Developer Toolset) is exactly that.  You can visit https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Developer_Toolset/ for more information.
I might have selected the wrong bug category - I'm currently using CentOS. I suppose the DTS do not exist for CentOS, so I'm screwed, right?
There's no reason why DTS wouldn't work on CentOS and DTS is freely available to Red Hat customers.

Based on c#3, this isn't going to be a fix we can/should backport, so I'm closing.
