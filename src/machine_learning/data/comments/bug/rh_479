Additional info:
This is the infamous "%*.*s" format bug in xorg. The problem has been fixed in xorg-x11-server-source-1.17.2-1.fc22 that has been produced just one day AFTER you compiled tigervnc-1.4.3-7 :-(
A simple rebuild of the tigervnc package with up to date dependencies resolves the problem.
