Description of problem:

I followed https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Default_Local_DNS_Resolver#Option_1_-_Use_experimental_implementation_available_in_Fedora_20_and_newer

and got:

SELinux is preventing dnssec-trigger- from relabelfrom access on the file /etc/resolv.conf.

*****  Plugin catchall (100. confidence) suggests   **************************

If you believe that dnssec-trigger- should be allowed relabelfrom access on the resolv.conf file by default.
Then you should report this as a bug.
You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
Do
allow this access for now by executing:
# grep dnssec-trigger- /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
# semodule -i mypol.pp

dnssec-trigger creates new resolv.conf with different name and then renames it to cope with possible issues if the resolv.conf is a symlink. I think that SELinux should allow dnssec-trigger to do that.

Also the SELinux reports in general could be more verbose, since most of the time I'm having a hard time understanding what actually happened.

Moving to selinux-policy.
Hi Tomas, 
Could you reproduce this issue in permissive mode? 
Thank you!

I'm not sure if I'll be able to. Setting NEEDINFO on the reporter...
OK, I need all AVCS to fix in in one step.
Yesterday, I relabeled my file system; system install was a fresh f22 install. I can not reproduce the issue any more.

Sorry for the noise.
