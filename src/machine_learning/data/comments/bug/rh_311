We trigger that, which does not seem to be correct:

  def dns?
    # host.managed? and managed? should always come first so that orchestration doesn't
    # even get tested for such objects
    (host.nil? || host.managed?) && managed? && hostname.present? && ip_available? && !domain.nil? && !domain.proxy.nil? && SETTINGS[:unattended]
  end

  def reverse_dns?
    # host.managed? and managed? should always come first so that orchestration doesn't
    # even get tested for such objects
    (host.nil? || host.managed?) && managed? && hostname.present? && ip_available? && !subnet.nil? && subnet.dns? && SETTINGS[:unattended]
  end
Since this issue was entered in Red Hat Bugzilla, the release flag has been
set to ? to ensure that it is properly evaluated for this release.
Actually this is invalid report.
I have filed documentation bug on this topic: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238091
