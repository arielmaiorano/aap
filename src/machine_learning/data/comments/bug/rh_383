This message is a reminder that Fedora 18 is nearing its end of life.
Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining
and issuing updates for Fedora 18. It is Fedora's policy to close all
bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time
this bug will be closed as WONTFIX if it remains open with a Fedora 
'version' of '18'.

Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you
plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' 
to a later Fedora version prior to Fedora 18's end of life.

Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we may not be 
able to fix it before Fedora 18 is end of life. If you would still like 
to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version 
of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora 
version prior to Fedora 18's end of life.

Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's 
lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a 
more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes 
bugs or makes them obsolete.

Fedora 18 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2014-01-14. Fedora 18 is
no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further
security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.

If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of
Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you
are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the
current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this
bug.

Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.

Reopening. As you can see at https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/problems/740148/ the crash still occurs in Fedora 20.

--- Additional comment from Eric L on 2014-04-23 08:03:21 EDT ---

Although Pidgin still occasionally crashes, I don't remember the newer FC20 versions ever hanging after pasting in HTML-formatted text from Chrome--the trigger for the initial crash report.

--- Additional comment from Seb L. on 2014-05-09 08:48:25 EDT ---

Hi,

I just got exactly the same problem on Fedora 20: crash immediately after deleting (delete key, not backspace) a <hr/>-like object, pasted from Firefox.

Here is the corresponding report from the problem tracker:
  https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/reports/71137/

--- Additional comment from Seb L. on 2014-05-09 09:09:19 EDT ---

Bug reproduction is trivial:
1) open the attached "make_pidgin_crash.html" with firefox;
2) copy the whole content;
3) paste it into pidgin's message composition area;
4) backspace until you reach the <hr />, which will cause Pidgin to crash.
[Pidgin crash]

Beautiful! As soon as I start backspacing (after doing a normal paste from Chrome), Pidgin crashes and spams variations of this to the terminal (during an strace):

brk(0)                                  = 0x2990000
brk(0x29b1000)                          = 0x29b1000
poll([{fd=6, events=POLLIN|POLLOUT}], 1, 4294967295) = 1 ([{fd=6, revents=POLLIN|POLLOUT}])
recvfrom(6, "\34\0\257T?\2\0\4(\0\0\0\371\315N\17\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 4096, 0, NULL, NULL) = 4096
writev(6, [{"\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0"..., 16384}, {NULL, 0}, {"", 0}], 3) = 16384
recvfrom(6, "\34\0/U?\2\0\4(\0\0\0\371\315N\17\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 4096, 0, NULL, NULL) = 1344
recvfrom(6, 0xaa88f4, 4096, 0, 0, 0)    = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)

The final recvfrom() call is repeated exactly as is, whereas the other recvfrom()s and writev() vary in their addresses/parameters/whatever they're called.

Pasting as unformatted text (so that test HTML simply becomes "A\nB") does not lead to a crash.

This is under version 2.10.9-1.fc20 (libpurple 2.10.9)

Found reference on the official Pidgin bug tracker to what is presumably the same bug.

Another user experienced a similar problem:

i have copied previous messages into message input, tried to remove empty lines and it crashed.

Bug still exist in Fedora 21.

Trivial to reproduce:
- create an account (e.g. bonjour protocol)
- open a chat with another user
- cut & paste an HTML <hr/>
- try to delete it using the backspace key
- watch Pidgin instantly crashing.
