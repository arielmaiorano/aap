Description of problem:

The sparse file support in lz4cat breaks piping.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

lz4-r129-1.fc22.x86_64

How reproducible:


Steps to Reproduce:
1. rpm -qi lz4 | lz4 | lz4cat

Actual results:

Error 68 : Skip error (sparse file)

Expected results:

Successful decompression.

Additional info:

Debian's version is based on r122 and does not have this problem.

A workaround is to use the --no-sparse option.
This has been fixed in the latest upstream release lz4-r130
