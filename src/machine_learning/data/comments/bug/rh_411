Description of problem:

libselinux-python / libselinux-python3 are python modules, if not specified in the spec as Require the software which is packaged and needs the module won't be able to run.

How reproducible:
  $ cat /etc/fedora-release 
  Fedora release 22 (Twenty Two)

  $ rpm -qa | grep -i rpmlint
  rpmlint-1.6-3.fc22.noarch

  Example running rpmlint:
  $ rpmlint ./python3-ovirt-register-1.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm 
  python3-ovirt-register.noarch: E: explicit-lib-dependency libselinux-python3

Example of software removing the Requires: libselinux-python3 in the spec:

  # cat /etc/fedora-release 
  Fedora release 22 (Twenty Two)

  # dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/python3-ovirt-register-1.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm

  # python3 /usr/bin/ovirt-register --engine-fqdn engine.mysuperdomain
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  <snip>
    import selinux
  ImportError: No module named 'selinux'

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
rpmlint-1.6-3.fc22.noarch

Expected results:
No complains/errors

Additional info:
Affects fedora-review tool output.

Example of spec:
https://github.com/dougsland/ovirt-register/raw/master/python-ovirt-register.spec
the "Requires: lib" check is not, and has never been terribly bright. In this case, it is clearly incorrect to remove Requires: libselinux-python[3].

Just note the false positive and move on with your day. :)
