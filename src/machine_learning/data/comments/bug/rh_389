Description:
This module provides an intuitive, Perl-ish way to write forking
programs by letting you use blocks to illustrate which code section
executes in which fork. The code for the parent, child, retry handler
and error handler are grouped together in a "fork block". The clauses
may appear in any order, but they must be consecutive (without any other
statements in between).

Consider adding a version constraint for Test::Script; the code requires 1.05+.

No blockers.  Approving.
