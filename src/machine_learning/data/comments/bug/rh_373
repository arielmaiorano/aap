Thanks for a bug report. I cannot tell for sure, but it seems to me that you hit a certain thread interleaving issue, which caused that an EWS connection object being use din one thread was freed meanwhile in another thread, causing this double free (it looks like a double free at least).

I moved this upstream as [1]. Please see [1] for any further updates. If possible, please CC yourself there, in case upstream developers will have additional questions.
