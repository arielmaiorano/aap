Description of problem:
I was installing, I chose a root password, and pressed done several times, because it was a poor password, I don't know if this has anything to do with the bug.

Version-Release number of selected component:
anaconda-core-22.20.13-1.fc22.x86_64

The following was filed automatically by anaconda:
