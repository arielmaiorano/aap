In the future, please attach the logs from /tmp to anaconda bugs, in particular the /tmp/anaconda-tb* file containing the full traceback data. The files you attached contain no useful information.

But I'm pretty sure this the bug fixed in https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/commit/905d0d8a0eb68c1cd98ceab151a31e0e227d256e. It will be in the next rawhide build.

ABRT did that, not me. It may be an idea to talk to the ABRT developers.
