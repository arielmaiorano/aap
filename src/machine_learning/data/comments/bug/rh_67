This bug is created as a clone of upstream ticket:
https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/47878

If setup-ds.pl -u is run to upgrade several instances it stops after the first failure to upgarde an instance. It should report an error, but continue to upgrade the other instances.

In addition we should verify in which state the failing instance is after aborting an upgrade. Is it reset to the previous state ?
sorry, wrong operation...
