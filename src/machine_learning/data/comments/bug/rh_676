Description of problem:

ansible man pages not available after installing via dnf


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):


How reproducible:


Steps to Reproduce:
1.sudo dnf install ansible
2.man -k ansible
3.

Actual results:

ansible: nothing appropriate

Expected results:

ansible (1)          - run a command somewhere else
ansible-doc (1)      - show documentation on Ansible modules
ansible-galaxy (1)   - manage roles using galaxy.ansible.com
ansible-playbook (1) - run an ansible playbook
ansible-pull (1)     - set up a remote copy of ansible on each managed node
ansible-vault (1)    - manage encrypted YAML data.

Additional info: 

I ran sudo mandb and was able to to get expected results. For whatever reason, the manual page index is not updated after installing ansible. This may be a bug with dnf itself.
currently man-db runs from a daily cron. I don't know if they plan to have some way to run on install or not, moving over there...
Hi,

apropos command (or man -k) uses man-db's cache to search for man pages containing a keyword in NAME sections. The cache is updated on a daily basis so it may take up to 1 day to get correct output of 'man -k ansible'. Otherwise man pages themselves are accessible right away. Typing 'man ansible' will work.

From f23 rpm should provide file triggers which can be used to update man-db's cache after each update/install of a package.

Cheers
Jan
