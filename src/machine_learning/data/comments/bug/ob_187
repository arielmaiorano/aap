The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590">CVE-2009-0590</a>)
or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789">CVE-2009-0789</a>).
These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
in the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt">OpenSSL security advisory</a>, but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.
