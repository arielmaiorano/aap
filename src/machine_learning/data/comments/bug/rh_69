This bug is created as a clone of upstream ticket:
https://fedorahosted.org/389/ticket/48140

MEP expects that the only time it will create a managed entry is on the addition of the entry. Modifying an existing entry and then having it retrospectively add the managed entry is not supported.

Currently, if one creates an object such as:

objectClass: top
objectClass: account
uid: foo
sn: bar

Followed by a mod operation to add posixAttributes, in a standard MEP with user -> group template, the group is not created, because the operation isn't considered unless it's an add.

This attached patch adds support and dynamic plugin tests to allow MEP to create managed entries if a mod operation would bring an entry into a state where it now satisfies the criteria of the template.
