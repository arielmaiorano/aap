Description of problem:

In Storage (tab) > export storage domain > VM Import (tab) > import dialog > Disks (tab), there is no way to select the destination Storage Domain.

The select-box is always forcing the selection of the first Storage Domain.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.6 alpha-2

How reproducible: Always on my setup

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Storage (tab) > export storage domain > VM Import (tab) > import dialog > Disks (tab)
2. Select a storage domain

Actual results:

The select-box is always forcing the selection of the first Storage Domain.
I cannot select a glusterfs data storage domain that is accessible by the selected cluster.

Expected results:

Ability to select other storage domain (the master storage domain in my case).


Additional info:

There is no problem in migrating to the desired storage-domain later (takes very long).
There is no difference when clone is checked or not.
