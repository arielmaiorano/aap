Additional info: Notice that the keepass version is showing as keepass.x86_64 2.26-9.fc21 whilst system is fc22
What's the environment variable $DISPLAY set to?  Have you tried any other Mono programs (e.g., banshee)?

echo $DISPLAY
:0
Haven't tried other mono programs, but running the portable version of keepass, running "mono KeePass.exe" gives same error.
Is this a fresh install or have you just upgraded from a previous Fedora version, and, if so, did it work then?

Also, the message "System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: The requested address is not valid in this context" makes me wonder if there is something unusual about the network config on your machine.
This is fedup 21 -->22. KeePass working fine on fc21
Not sure what could be unusual about network config. Anything related to firewalld?
Not sure what changed, except kernel update, but Keepass in now working on my fc22 machine.
4.0.6-300.fc22.x86_64
Curious!
