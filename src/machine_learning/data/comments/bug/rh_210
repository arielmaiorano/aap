Description of problem:
I upgraded to qemu-2:2.3.0-11.fc23 (Rawhide) today and I started getting : "error: unsupported configuration: spice graphics are not supported with this QEMU" when I run "virsh start foo".

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
qemu-2:2.3.0-11.fc23

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.virsh start foo

Additional info:
Dr. David Alan Gilbert asked me to run 'qemu-system-x86_64 -spice port=5555' and I got the following output:
qemu-system-x86_64: -spice port=5555: There is no option group 'spice'
spice is not supported by this qemu build.

spice support     no

Sorry, I have qemu-2.3.0-12.fc23
This is caused by a failure to detect spice support, which means the configure compile test failed. So this is ultimately likely a spice bug.

The QEMU spec is bad  though - it should use --enable-spice when running configure so that we can get a fatal error if spice support is broken, rather than silently building QEMU without spice.
Yeah I broke that in spice-protocol 0.12.8

I hope we will not wait a year for the next release, again.
:)
Rebuilding QEMU against spice-0.12.5-8.fc23 should fix this problem.
$ qemu-kvm -version
QEMU emulator version 2.3.0 (qemu-2.3.0-15.fc23), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard

PASSED

Thanks.
