Description of problem:
When a system has two interfaces for example eth1 and eth0 in two different subnets, bringing one of them down should display the status information as "eth1:down".

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
nagios-server-addons-0.2.1-3.el6rhs.noarch

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a system which has two interfaces say eth0 and eth1 with ip addresses in two different subnets.
2. Now bring down one of the interface.
3.

Actual results:
Status information shows "could not complete ssl handshake"

Expected results:
status information should display "eth1:down,eth0:UP"

Additional info:
This issue seems to be an issue with network configuration - the reverse lookup of  hostname (nagios server) is failing when one of the interfaces is brought down

The issue is not related to nagios or nrpe.
As per comment 3, closing this
