Section Number and Name: 
Java

Describe the issue: 
This section should not exist as we are not shipping a plain java builder.
Verified that the Customer Portal docs build has been updated in production and the Java image topic no longer appears:

https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-using-images#source-to-image-s2i

It still exists in the Origin docs:

https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/java.html

Further, the build script for the CP build has been updated to avoid hitting this type of issue again (i.e., respect when topics are conditionalized for certain distros in the TOC).
