use of pkg-config to get opencv CFLAGS and LIBS

Description of problem:
We are trying to compile dependent packages with OpenCV 3.0.0 (See #1230078). The compilation of simarrange failed with following error message:

/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccSDJuLu.o: undefined reference to symbol 'cvSaveImage'
/usr/lib64/libopencv_imgcodecs.so.3.0: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line

In attachment is patch which should fix this issue. I would like to ask you for review of that patch.

I have created an COPR repository for testing of the package:
https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jmlich/opencv3/build/102202/

It seems, fedora is using downstream script to compile this package. I have asked upstream to modify their build scripts accordingly.

Thanks for the patch. I'll wait a bit for the upstream to accept your changes (as it seems likely) and use that instead.
OK, applying the patch. Will take changes from upstream later, when available.
