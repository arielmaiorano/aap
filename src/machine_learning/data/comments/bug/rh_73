Description of problem:

From Tom Hennessy:  

Marianne,
As a part of my standard appliance bashing I routinely set all reports to be scheduled to run several times per day.  

When I started this today for CFME 3.2 I noticed that there are 117 reports shipped in the starter VMDB instead of 124 shipped previously.

Is there any documentation indicating which reports were removed?

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

Additional info:

setting component to Documentation until I find where the disconnect is.
using /var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/doc/reports_to_csv.rb to generate list from 5.4 and 5.3
Two things, first of all when I ran my report of Reports, I got 120 for 5.4 and 127 for 5.3.  So, the difference is still 7.

The change is simply the removal of the reports related to VDI, which is no longer supported in 5.4.
