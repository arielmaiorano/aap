ABRT failed creating a backtrace. Here's one with debuginfo missing. Could be related to the brandnew gnutls (as there's a report about a gnutls crash in Claws Mail, too).

vinagre crashes in exactly the same way just by starting it and exiting it.
Reassigning to gnutls.

Flooding me with reports will not solve the issue. Could you please reply to the questions asked?
Sorry if you feel that way after just 2-3 tickets. I only have limited time to spend on Rawhide, and while I'm running into crashes, I report them. Tickets with a wrong assignee won't "solve" anything either.

Rawhide should be kept in a working state. I'd like to understand what is the culprit of all these crashes that mention gnutls.
You did well reassigning the tickets, but since this will affect almost every program linked with gnutls, it is counter-productive to spend your energy to reassign every possible bug. Responding to requests will help fix the bug sooner.

Anyway, these specific crashes should be solved by gnutls-3.4.2-2.fc23 build, irrespective of the mass rebuild. Please reopen if they don't.

Even sooner?

Even on IRC response times can be slower, and bugzilla isn't a real-time chat.

You're far from fair here. In bug 1230889, one could say that six days have been wasted without thinking about a fix. It's simply your latest gnutls fix that fixes all these crashes.
Indeed I was not fair. You responded and because of that the issue was fixed. About #1230889 it is your turn not to be fair, as I asked rel-eng for recompilation. There was not much else that could be done as the issue was not visible there. It was you who sent the backtrace, so kudos for that.
