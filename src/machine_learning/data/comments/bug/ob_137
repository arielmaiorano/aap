A FIFO bug was introduced in OpenBSD 3.5 that occurs when a FIFO is opened in
non-blocking mode for writing when there are no processes reading the FIFO.
One program affected by this is the <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a>
mail server which could go into an infinite loop and consume all CPU.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
