Description of problem:

When doing "dnf install wine" on a x86_64 system, most arch dependent packages are included in their 64 and 32 bit versions, but not wine-alsa which is only supplied as 64 bit.

You need wine-alsa.i686 when running a windows music application that depends on MIDI - most of those I know are 32 bit (admittedly, not many of the wine users may need MIDI).

I had a hard time trying to make Band-in-a-Box 2013 find a soft synth (fluidsynth) as MIDI output device until, after a lot of googling, I found a hint to wine-alsa being a missing prerequisite for MIDI support:

(the op of this 5 years old thread was indeed me which I really had forgotten ...)
