Please provide the code snippet you used. Thanks!
Possibly related to bug 1108006. 
Juan - do you want to take a look, or should we have someone from the Storage team take take lead on this?
This can be the same that bug 1108006 or also bug 1230270. I don't see any hint in the attached engine log.

In order to determine if this is a duplicate we will need to have a simple reproducer, including the debug output of the command line. Please run the following command with the relevant VM and disk identifier:

  # rhevm-shell -d
  [RHEVM shell (connected)]# update disk --vm-identifier {vm:id} {disk:id} --alias newalias

In my environment this worked correctly.
This is duplicate of bug 1230270.
Thanks Juan
