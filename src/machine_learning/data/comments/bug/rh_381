Description of problem:
When listing configuration profile in grid view, quadicon name strings do not contain names of the configuration profiles but their respective href links.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
5.4.0.5

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add foreman
2. Go to a configuration provider (manager) and change the display view to
   'grid' (default is 'list')

Actual results:
Quadicons with names such as "/provider_foreman/x_show/5"

Expected results:
Quadicons with names such as "centos-server-profile"

Additional info:
Note: the default list view displays names correctly, the issue is only present with grid view
This has already been addressed in upstream.

There is also a MR for 5.4.z which includes a fix for this issue -
