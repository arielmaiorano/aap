Description of problem:
Ctrl+K shortcut for Firefox no longer goes to the search box when the caret is inside an <input> in any page.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
firefox-38.0.5-2.fc22.x86_64


How reproducible:
Always.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page that has an <input>.
2. Select that input.
3. Press Ctrl+K.


Actual results:
Nothing happens.


Expected results:
Select search box (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Keyboard+shortcuts#w_search)


Additional info:
Ctrl+J works fine.
Ctrl+K works in Windows on same FF version.
When in the address bar, Ctrl+K clears it (It should act as Ctrl+J).
I could get used to Ctrl+J, but this seems a bug anyway. Ctrl+K should work everywhere as it has been always, not just outside inputs.
Unfortunately that's a Gtk3 bug and we can't fix that (at least I don't know how). See Bug 1224605 for workaround.
