Line 59 isn't necessary these days.  If you remove it, you can also drop the dependency on coreutils and findutils.

The explicit version constraint for Log::Log4perl isn't necessary.  perl-generators pick this up from the code.

I think the License tag should be changed to `LGPLv2', omitting the plus sign.  Upstream explicitly declares the version in the module file.
Updated files are available on the same links.
Ack, approving.
