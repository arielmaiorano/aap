Description of problem:

iiuc notifier app by default would notify only for explicitly defined filter entries, thus those you are "enabled" are included. that means there's "transparent" exclude in the code. that's ok.

but if you do following:

# grep ^FILTER /etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/my.conf 
FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:jbelka@redhat.com) ${FILTER}"

then FILTER var will contain app default behavior even you don't have exclude FILTER entry in the conf file.

# /etc/init.d/ovirt-engine-notifier restart ; tail -f /var/log/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.log | egrep 'Value of property.*FILTER|addFilterEntry'
Stopping oVirt Engine Notifier:                            [  OK  ]
Starting oVirt Engine Notifier:                            [  OK  ]
2015-07-02 14:53:04,380 INFO    [org.ovirt.engine.core.uutils.config.ShellLikeConfd dumpConfig] Value of property 'FILTER' is 'include:VDC_START(smtp:jbelka@redhat.com) exclude:*'.

^^^ ${FILTER} got value 'exclude:*'

IMHO this is useless and having FILTER=${FILTER} as first filter entry could bring surprises why following filter entries are not accepted.

So IMO default exclude behaviour should be kept but auto-added as last rule and not to be populated into FILTER.

If anybody would like to exclude anything, he can use 'exclude' keyword and think about order of filter entries.

Plus, I would comment following line, it does not make much sense.

# grep ^FILTER /usr/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine-notifier/ovirt-engine-notifier.conf
FILTER="exclude:*"

Although default behaviour should be documented in conf file (as you don't have man pages).

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
ovirt-engine-tools-3.6.0-0.0.master.20150627185750.git6f063c1.el6.noarch

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have only this line in conf file - FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:foobar@example.com) ${FILTER}"
2. /etc/init.d/ovirt-engine-notifier restart ; tail -f /var/log/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.log | egrep 'Value of property.*FILTER'
3.

Actual results:
default app behaviour leaks into FILTER variable

Expected results:
nothing should leak into variables if it is not written in conf file

Additional info:
it is yours/sysadmin call if one wants he current settings to be appended or not, the logic nor configuration enforces that.

you can entire:

FILTER="whatever"
FILTER="${FILTER} whatever"
FILTER="whatever ${FILTER}"

based on the conf.d logic the previous filter setting can be used or not.

this is as standard conf.d is designed.

so unless I am missing something closing this as not a bug.

thanks
As far as understand this bug, this 'leak' is the intended behavior of FILTER.

FILTER is a "first match filter" -  For each combination of subscriber/method/event the first matching pattern is acted upon and evaluation stops.

FILTER is assembled from orderly evaluation of multiple config files - This is also how we instruct users to build it in help documents; each file a user adds can prepend to the value of FILTER leaving earlier defined rules for non matching events.

There is no code default, but the basic rule in our default conf file is: "exclude everything". if it makes sense to a user he can define FILTER="include:*(smtp:admin@example.com) $FILTER" (=FILTER="include:*" because this rules matches everything anyway, so no need to keep evaluating).


One file does no give the complete value of filter:
# grep ^FILTER /etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/my.conf 
FILTER="include:VDC_START(smtp:jbelka@redhat.com) ${FILTER}"

The right place to look is the log:
'FILTER' is 'include:VDC_START(smtp:jbelka@redhat.com) exclude:*'.
