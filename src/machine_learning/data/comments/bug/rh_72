Description of problem:

When building in Koji, pbr attempts to download from PyPi and blows up.

Download error on https://pypi.python.org/simple/pbr/: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution -- Some packages may not be found!
Couldn't find index page for 'pbr' (maybe misspelled?)

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

python-pbr-0.11.0-2.fc23.noarch

How reproducible:

Synchronous but may depend on package set etc.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a spec of an OpenStack package with pbr (see attached)
2. fedpkg srpm
3. fedpkg --dist f23 build --scratch --srpm git-review-1.25.0-1.fc23.src.rpm

Actual results:

Crash

Expected results:

RPM is built
