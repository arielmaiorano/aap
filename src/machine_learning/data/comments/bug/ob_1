The Intel P5 F00F bug was discovered after the CDRs had already been
sent to the manufacturer.  This problem permits any user who has an account
to lock your machine up using a 4-line program.  The problem only affects
Intel P5 processors (the i386, i486, P-Pro, and P-II are not vulnerable,
nor are processors by other manufacturers).

A kernel source-code patch is available</a>.
