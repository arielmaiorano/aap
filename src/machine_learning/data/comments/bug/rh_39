Description of problem: For https://access.redhat.com/articles/1258893
  "Migrate a Live (running) Instance"

From Daniel Berrange: In the section
 "‚Å†2.1. Configure Secure Libvirt"
It has a list with 3 secure ways of setting up libvirt:

[quote]
 - TLS for encryption and X.509 client certificates for authentication
 - GSSAPI/Kerberos for auth+data encryption
 - TLS for encryption and Kerberos for authentication
[/quote]


It then has a "Table 1. Libvirt Parameters" which lists the libvirtd.conf configuration options for 3 setups. But the setups listed in this table do not
correspond to the 3 secure setups listed in the previous paragraph's list.

What is even worse is that the 3rd option in the table is recommending customners to open what is equivalent to a remote root shell. This is a massive
security risk for our customers.

Please remove the current contents of "Table 1. Libvirt Parameters" replacing it with the following

In Row 1
  "TLS encryption + x509 certs authentication"

  listen_tls=1
  listen_tcp=0
  auth_tls="none"
  tls_no_verify_certificate=0
  tls_allowed_dn_list = ["C=GB,ST=London,L=London,O=Red Hat,CN=*"] *

  * - replace example x509 distinguish name pattern match
      with one suitable the certificates you issue for servers

In Row 2
  "GSSAPI/kerberos encryption + authentication"

  listen_tls=0
  listen_tcp=1
  auth_tcp="sasl"
  sasl_allowed_username_list = ["libvirt/*.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"] *

  * - replace example kerberos principal name pattern match
      with one suitable for the tickets you issue for servers

In Row 3
  "TLS encryption + Kerberos authentication"

  listen_tls=1
  listen_tcp=0
  auth_tls="sasl"
  sasl_allowed_username_list = ["libvirt/*.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"] *

  * - replace example kerberos principal name pattern match
      with one suitable for the tickets you issue for servers
