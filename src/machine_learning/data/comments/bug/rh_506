When using HP iLO (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out)
booting in legacy text mode makes it a lot simpler to debug.

The question is:

Does uefi bios support setting vga text mode?

or

Can the kernel set a text mode during boot
after uefi boot?
No, there's no such thing as VGA text mode on UEFI.  There are other debug options, such as earlyprintk=efi .
Development Management has reviewed and declined this request.
You may appeal this decision by reopening this request.
