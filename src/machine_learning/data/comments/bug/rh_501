Install bash completion

Thanks, this resolves bug #1096322, which I keep forgetting because I use zsh.  :-(

But if you apply it can you split the %license change into a seperate patch please? I definitely want the bash completion fix in all branches. :-D
Done and building, http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=10216071
