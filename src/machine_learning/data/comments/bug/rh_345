Description of problem:
After a major distro upgrade, debuginfo packages will not be updated, neither with dnf or dnf distrosync.
yum instead, used to do that.

I could not retrieve a log because I have already erased F21 debuginfos and I am downloading F22 debuginfo packages right now.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
$ dnf --version
1.0.1

Editing title because DNF does not update debuginfo packages in every situation, not only after a distro upgrade. To update them you must run 
# dnf debuginfo-install packagename
Just enable *-debuginfo repositories to have debuginfo packages updated automatically.
Closing. Germano, if solution from comment 2 doesn't help, feel free to reopen.
