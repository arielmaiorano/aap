Error: package filezilla-3.10.3-1.fc22.x86_64 requires libwx_gtk3u_core-3.0.so.0()(64bit), but none of the providers can be installed


Expected results:
Actually install Filezilla


Additional info:
This is an upgrades f21 install. Before I got to this problem, filezilla was installed but unable to run due to missing `libwx_gtk3u_*` libraries. So I uninstalled it and now I'm here with this problem.

I have both the mangelajo-kicad and the rpmfusion-* repos installed.

I would think I'd need the wxGTK3 packages installed, but those don't seem to contain any libraries in them, or if so they don't install anything named `libwx_gtk3*`
No I don't think so, I've several f22 installed system running filezilla just fine. This doesn't permit any doubt about any error with filezilla.
Something else is broken on your system, please read again the upgrade procedure and try to clean-up things with yum/dnf and copr/3rd part repository.
