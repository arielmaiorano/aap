Description of problem:
This package does not include a dist tag (e.g. '.fc23') in its release field, even though it is mandatory according the packaging guidelines:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:DistTag

Our automated testing efforts are beginning to rely on having a dist tag in RPM file names:
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/packaging/2015-June/thread.html#10693

Please adjust the package spec file and add '%{?dist}' at the end of the release field. Do this for all supported Fedora releases.

It is not necessary to build a new package version immediately, but it should be prepared in the spec file so that a new package build in the future will contain the dist tag.

Thank you.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
xmms-lirc-0:1.4-21.x86_64
Taking.

Additionally to the missing dist-tag, this packages FTBFS, apparently, because it doesn't honor CFLAGS.

I am going to apply more intrusive changes to this package.
