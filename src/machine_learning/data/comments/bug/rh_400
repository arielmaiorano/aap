Description of problem:
After the update to Thunderbird 38 (thunderbird-38.0.1-2.fc22 the extension Lightning does not work anymore. When Thunderbird starts the following message is shown:

"The binary component required for Lightning could not be loaded, likely because the wrong version combination is being used. You currently have Lightning 4.0.0.1 installed, but should be using a version from the 4.0 series."

The following message is stored in Thunderbird Error Console:

"Failed to load native module at path '/home/user/.thunderbird/d3r5t6t6.default/extensions/{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}/components/libcalbasecomps.so': (80004005) /home/user/.thunderbird/d3r5t6t6.default/extensions/{e2fda1a4-762b-4020-b5ad-a41df1933103}/components/libcalbasecomps.so: failed to map segment from shared object"

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Name        : thunderbird
Arch        : x86_64
Epoch       : 0
Version     : 38.0.1
Release     : 2.fc22

How reproducible:
Update or re-install Thunderbird, and start it afterwards.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update Thunderbird to version 38
2. Start Thunderbird

Actual results:
The extension lighting is not loaded/working correctly. 

Expected results:
A working lightning extension

Additional info:
I disabled the extension and install version 4.0.0.1 from the Mozilla Repository with the same result. I get the same error message when I start Thunderbird.
