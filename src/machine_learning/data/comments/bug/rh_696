Description of problem:
we are using an insecure password hash on the kickstart files, which allow for spinning/ISO building.In some other kickstarts Ive seen this duplicated also.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
21/22

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.look at the kickstart files for livecd-creator from specified package

Actual results:
using insecure md5 for hashing

Expected results:
use sha256 instead

Additional info:
patch line containing 'auth --useshadow --enablemd5' to read:

auth --useshadow --passalgo=sha512 

--as documented on RedHat website for use of livecd-creator kickstart 'auth'. This could create SEVERE SECURITY problems if installed in this manner.For some reason we are using sha512 when installed but not on the live 'CD'.

check with:
authconfig --test | grep hashing (as any user).
Fixed in spin-kickstarts git: 9f254062c3c78d8480b04b340c1497c08126c0ca

Note that this really doesn't affect the live or cloud images we make, as they don't have passwords at all, but I could see someone basing their spin on one of our kickstarts and getting md5, so it's good to change. 

We can't really change 21/22 as those reflect how the releases were made, but 23 and beyond should be changed.
