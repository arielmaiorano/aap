The Emacs add-on packging guidelines no longer stipulate that elisp source files be shipped in a separate sub-package. The -el subpackage should be removed, and the elisp source files should be packaged in the main package. See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Emacs for more detail, and please take note of the Obsoletes/Provides concern noted there.
This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.
I've retired this package, since it doesn't function with the current ibus and the upstream is not interesting in further development.
