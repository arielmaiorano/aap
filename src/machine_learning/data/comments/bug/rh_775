Additional info:
python-pillow-2.0.0-17.gitd1c6db8  is the RHEL7 version, an EPEL6 package at th exact same version would be wonderful
There is already python-imaging in the core package set of EL6, python-pillow would conflict with that. So I fear this cannot be done, unless I'm missing something.
