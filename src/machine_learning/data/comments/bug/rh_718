Description: This package is an addon to GAPDoc that enables generating documentation from GAP source code.
I do have a question regarding use of {?_isa} in the Requires, mainly for my
own understanding going forward.

I reviewed:  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Requires_2
It mentions:  "As a rule of thumb, if the version is not required, don't add it just for fun."

It doesn't directly apply that to arch, but I felt the inference carried over to the other items.

In my own package which was noarch, I added several Requires, but didn't specify arch; since the 386 version or the x86 version would work fine.  

Since this package is also noarch, why would you specify arch?  Is there a technical reason or just preference?

None of the items listed below are blockers.  If you wish to incorporate some of the suggestions, do so and post the new Spec so I can approve.  If not, just advise and I then approve the current Spec.

Package Review
==============

Legend:
[x] = Pass, [!] = Fail, [-] = Not applicable, [?] = Not evaluated
[ ] = Manual review needed

SHOULD:

- RPMLINT is complaining about zero length files:
  E: zero-length /usr/lib/gap/pkg/AutoDoc/doc/AutomaticDocumentation.bbl
  E: zero-length /usr/lib/gap/pkg/AutoDoc/doc/AutoDoc.bbl
  These should be removed if not needed for something.  
  You can do this in   %install section:
  ====> find $RPM_BUILD_ROOT -size "0" -exec rm -f {} ';'

- The spell checker is complaining about "addon", 
  and in this case it is correct.  It should be
  add-on; however, if you change it, it probably will 
  report that as a misspelling.  <sigh>

- gap-pkg-autodoc.noarch: W: only-non-binary-in-usr-lib
  I found this:  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=483199
  and from what I can gather this shouldn't have been generated because
  you have noarch specified.  Thoughts?

Short story: I copied another, arch-specific, spec file I had just worked on to start, and just forgot to remove the %{?_isa} tags.  You are correct: this is a noarch package and %{?_isa} is not useful.  Removed.

Done.

Fixed.

This is an artifact of how gap itself is packaged, I suspect.  Anyway, there's nothing I can do about it in this package.  The files need to go where they go.

This is common practice in the GAP world.  GAP package authors tend to not put any notices in their source files, but to note the license for the entire project in the documentation.  (In this case, doc/AutoDoc.tex and doc/AutomaticDocumentation.tex both identify the license.)

> - %check is present and all tests pass.

While many GAP packages come with test code, this one, sadly, does not.  I'm not sure what to do about that.

By the way, when you take a review, you should mark the bug status as Assigned.  See step 3 of https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_Review_Process#Reviewer.

I thought it did that automatically.  I took the bug, and changed the fedora-review flag to '?'.  

Anyway, approved.  ;-)
BTW, thanks for pointing that out.  I always wondered why so many bugs always showed status of "NEW"... I'm going to file a bug request on this.  They should be able to automatically change the status to "ASSIGNED" when someone "TAKES" the bug report.  That's the way I thought it worked, and as my bug list shows, quite a few other folks are thinking the same thing.
Yeah, I've pointed that out to quite a few people.  Thanks for the review.  I owe you.
