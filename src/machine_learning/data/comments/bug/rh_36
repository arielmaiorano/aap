Description of problem:
The library libclamunrar is not present in the clamav EPEL5 package (which provides clamav-lib itself). Thus, some compressed contents cannot be scanned by ClamAV. Check out Dag Wieers' version which does include it: http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/dag/redhat/el5/i386/clamav-0.98.4-1.el5.rf.i386.html


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
clamav-0.98.7-1.el5

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.yum whatprovides libclamunrar.so.6
2.
3.

Actual results:
RAR-compressed files cannot be scanned.

Expected results:
RAR files should be scanned.

Additional info:
clamscan --debug outputs the following warnings:

LibClamAV debug: searching for unrar: libclamunrar_iface.so.6.1.26 not found
LibClamAV debug: searching for unrar: libclamunrar_iface.so.6 not found
LibClamAV debug: searching for unrar: libclamunrar_iface.so not found
LibClamAV debug: searching for unrar: libclamunrar_iface.a not found
LibClamAV debug: Cannot dlopen libclamunrar_iface: file not found - unrar support unavailable
Thank you for your report. However it is intended that there is no unrar
support, because unrar is only freeware with further limitations but not
published under an open source license.
