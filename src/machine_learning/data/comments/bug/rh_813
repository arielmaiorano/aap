Do you remember the circumstances when this happened?

Unfortunately I don't remember.
Uhm, seems like a crash a number of people have encountered [1]. I'll need to investigate. If this ever happens again to you, any additional info would certainly be welcome.

I'm afraid I really need to have at least some pointer at when this happens, it looks like some kind of memory corruption, but is really hard to debug this without knowing where to look - it might even be a bug deeper down in gtk. I'm closing this with INSUFFICIENT_DATA, but please do reopen if you ever manage to reproduce this again.
