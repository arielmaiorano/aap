When attempting to do an overcloud deploy specifying an ntp server e.g.


openstack overcloud deploy --control-scale 1 --compute-scale 1 --ceph-storage-scale 0 --block-storage-scale 0 --swift-storage-scale 0 --neutron-public-interface eth1 --nodes-json instackenv.json --overcloud_nameserver 192.168.1.1 --floating-ip-cidr 192.168.1.0/24 --floating-ip-start 192.168.1.230 --floating-ip-end 192.168.1.240 --bm-network-gateway 192.168.1.1 --use-tripleo-heat-templates --tripleo-root /home/stack/openstack-deployment/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates --ntp-server 0.au.pool.ntp.org

It fails with the following error

    "deploy_stderr": "\u001b[1;31mWarning: The package type's allow_virtual parameter will be changing its default value from false to true in a future release.

    "deploy_status_code": 6
  }

Hard to read but the important part is

Failed to issue method call: Unit ntpd.service failed to load: No such file or directory

can we please make sure ntpd is installed and configured on the overcloud images? Likewise, maybe we should be looking at using systemds timedatectl and chrony instead?

Can you please make sure you list relevant package versions or at least puddle/poodle that you're using?

In this case, I'm going to assume that you're using the 29.1 puddle which did not yet have bug 1233916 fixed

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1233916 ***
Sorry yeah I was using 29.1 in which case this duplication is correct.

I'll make sure to put the puddle/poodle in the future
