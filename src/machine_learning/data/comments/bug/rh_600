The Emacs add-on packaging guidelines no longer stipulate that packages which also bundle support for Emacs should split out those Emacs files into separate sub-packages. This package should instead ship those files with the main package which should also Require emacs-filesystem. See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Emacs for more detail.

Ho Jonathan,
thanks for patch. I did some modification, please check it if you are ok with it.
Looks ok to me, though I can't immediately see what changed :)
- files from emacs* packages are moved to git instead of git-core
- for obsoletes/provides used only version - without release
Ah, right. Gottit. Looks good!
Thanks!
Thank you too :-) Good job.
