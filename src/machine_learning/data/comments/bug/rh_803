Description of problem:
I am trying to setup an AD member server. I followed the wiki (https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_a_Samba_AD_Member_Server).
The domain join succeeded

But wbinfo fails:

$ wbinfo -u
Error looking up domain users

I tried to increase windbind log verbosity to 10, but I can see no trace when issuing wbinfo:
/etc/smb.conf
       log level = winbind:10 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
samba-winbind-clients-4.1.17-1.fc21.x86_64
samba-4.1.17-1.fc21.x86_64
