When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.
<br>
Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
<pre>
    nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...
</pre>
Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
<pre>
    nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...
</pre>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
