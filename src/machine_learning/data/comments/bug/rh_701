Hi,
Why is Libreoffice not Updated to the currently version?

It´ s the 4.2 release in the repo but 4.4 is aviable
4.4 is currently too early in its life cycle (i.e. too buggy) to get into RHEL, but there's already a RFE for upgrading to 4.3 in RHEL7 -> duplicate

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1205091 ***
oh, i´ ve run 4.4 without any problems it´ s working fine for me
