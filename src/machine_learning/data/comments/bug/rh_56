Thanks for a bug report. From what I understand from the backtrace, the crash happened after a change in the currently selected folder was propagated into the UI. Some mails were removed from the view, when an incorrect pointer was used, which caused the crash. Why the pointer was incorrect I do not see from the backtrace.
I tried to reproduce this, with added debugging into the related sources, thus I saw the code in question was called, and it didn't crash for me. One option to invoke this was to collapse a thread in the threading view with the cursor inside the collapsed subtree.

I'm afraid there is nothing to be done, unless a reproducer is found.
