The kernel was using a fixed and hard-coded location for the arguments
vector passed from the <strong>/boot</strong> loader.  This prevented
<strong>/boot</strong> from placing the boot arguments vector at any
other location, causing a kernel crash early in the autoconfiguration
stage.  In 2.5, the bootblocks will be modified to use a new location.
Hence, if you wish old kernels to boot on a new bootblock, those
kernels will only work if they were linked with this patch.
