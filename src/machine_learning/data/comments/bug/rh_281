Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): translator-infinispan-dsl 8.7.1
I've duplicated the issue in DV 6.2 and I believe I have found the problem.  Will do more testing tomorrow to verify the fix works in DV 6.1.
I've got a fix for this, is this something you are going to file a client ticket on to get it into a roll-up?   Or do you want a patch to work with for the time being?
