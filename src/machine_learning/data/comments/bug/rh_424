Description of problem:
As the MATE desktop starts up, the Synaptics touchpad (psmouse serio1: synaptics: Touchpad model: 1, fw: 7.0, id: 0x1c0b1, caps: 0xd04791/0xb00000/0x20000, board id: 0, fw id: 434116) stops working. It works initially, and scratching in a circle moves the mouse until about the time the top panel in the MATE desktop appears. After that, there's no response from the touchpad or the touchpad buttons on MATE. (It still works fine under GNOME.)

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Started with the upgrade from F21 to F22.

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to MATE Desktop
2.
3.

Actual results:
Touchpad and buttons work through the initial part of the MATE initialization, but about the time the top panel appears, the touchpad becomes unresponsive.

Expected results:
Expect to be able to use the touch pad and buttons to move the mouse pointer.

Problem persists as per original report. Synaptics touchpad still unresponsive after starting MATE Desktop. The touchpad does work in a VT, and on the login screen, and I can "sudo cat /dev/char/13:68" and scratch on the pad and get junk blurted onto the screen. But MATE doesn't respond to it. (Fortunately, the trackpoint "eraser" thing works.) It used to work before the upgrade to F22.

There is a new feature in f22 which installs 'libinput' driver, but mate or cinnamon doesn't support this driver.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/LibinputForXorg

[root@mother xorg.conf.d]# ls
10-evdev.conf      50-vmmouse.conf   99-synaptics-cinnamon.conf
10-quirks.conf     50-wacom.conf     99-synaptics-mate.conf
50-synaptics.conf  90-libinput.conf  nvidia.conf

90-libinput.conf has a higher priority than 50-synaptics.conf
For this reason i create the 99-synaptics-mate.conf with the update.
In result X use the synaptics driver in mate session.
This works with my notebook and i have the touchpad tap in mate-mouse-properties and my touchpad is working.

So, is xorg-x11-drv-synaptics installed?
Did you get an output with 'synclient' which indicates that the synaptics driver is loaded?
Do you have /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf ?
Do you have this symlink after installing mate-desktop-1.10.0-7.fc22 ?
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-synaptics-mate.conf
You can also check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log if the synaptic driver is in use.
Please answer to all the questions.

This is very helpful info; thank you.

Yes, and it owns /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf

Yes, with 59 "parameter = ##" pairs reported.

Ok, all looks good,
synaptic driver is runing and i see no failures.
Do you use gdm as login manager?
Maybe gdm calls xorg-x11-drv-libinput and switching to xorg-x11-drv-synaptics causes the isue in a running X.
You can also try uninstall xorg-x11-drv-libinput for testing.
Gnome should also run withs synaptic driver as mentioned in wiki.

No. lightdm

Neither gdm, xorg-x11-drv-libinput, or libinput are installed on this system. I did try again after installing them and again after re-removing them: no difference. The touchpad is responsive in lightdm, but not after MATE Desktop loads. Touchpad works with LXDE, and ever so briefly while MATE is starting, but quits about the time icons / top panel appear.
There is no change in Mate-1.10 about input devices.
Did you check with dconf-editor or mate-mouse-properties if all settings are correct?
Is this gsettings key enabled?
[rave@mother ~]$ gsettings get org.mate.peripherals-touchpad touchpad-enabled
true

No, it was not set! After

[utoddl@foo]$ gsettings set org.mate.peripherals-touchpad touchpad-enabled true

it immediately started working again -- first time since the F22 upgrade.

So, what could possibly have turned this setting false? The System->Preferences->Hardware->Mouse app has had a Touchpad tab, and I've twiddled everything there many times over during the last month, but there's nothing there that says "Enable touchpad () Yes (*) No".

Very glad to have this working; thanks. Very frustrated at the invisibility of this switch. (Are users supposed to dig into gsettings outside of the GUI?)

Thanks again.
Glad to hear that it works again for you :)
Hard to say what can cause this change in your settings, maybe through the upgrade.
There is also a major glib2 change for gsettings with f22,
most stuff is adjusted for this in mate-1.10, but not all.
Upstream is working on it.
So if you notice that a settings change don't work, simply restart the session and the setting will apply ;)

sounds like a good improvement, maybe you can file out a feature request for it at mate at github and mention this report there.
Opened an issue (https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-desktop/issues/178) upstream as suggested. Thanks again.
