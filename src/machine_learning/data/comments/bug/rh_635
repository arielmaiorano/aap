This was after a logout/login?

Or what were you doing when it happened?

Can you duplicate the crash?
It was not immediately after a logout or login; I had a terminal or two open in the background and I think I just closed one from the XFCE taskbar -> right-click -> Close. I've obviously done that a lot before and after this without problems; I can't reproduce the crash.
