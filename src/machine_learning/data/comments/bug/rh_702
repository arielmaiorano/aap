It is not possible to update to any version greater than 3.12, as the version of Vala in RHEL7 is too old.

Vala is part of RHEL7, so it does not have a separate EPEL7 version. There will be a Vala update for RHEL7.2, which should be recent enough to get a more recent version of Simple Scan into EPEL7 once 7.2 is released.
aha :-)
so it where nice to know the release date of centos 7.2

YEEARRR vala-0.26.1-2.el7 has been builtlook at Bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1174432 so you can release highter versions of simple-scan so i hope
Once RHEL 7.2 has been released, yes, but not before (as that version of Vala is not yet in the buildroot, because it has not yet passed QA testing).
simple-scan-3.12.2-1.el7 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.
