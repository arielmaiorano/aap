How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Easytag

3. Do a CDDB Search --> Sucess
4. Do it a second time (also with another album)--> It will fail with a "The server retuned a bad responce".

Expected results:


Additional info:
Thanks for the bug report. I just fixed this upstream:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/easytag/commit/?id=4f2daf8860378b2903d078d054adc452d516835c

The fix will be in the next release, which should be 2.4.0 and will probably be out later today. Until then, you can work around the problem by keeping the CDDB dialogue open between searches.
