perl-Mozilla-PublicSuffix-0.1.19-5.fc23 fails to build in F23 because build script fails because build-time dependency on `perl(open) is not declared:

Can't locate open.pm in @INC (you may need to install the open module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 .) at Build.PL line 6.

Thanks for the bug report and sorry for not paying attention.
Should be fixed in 0.1.19-6 in rawhide.
