Please provide dwhd logs.

Can you try restarting dwhd before running setup, and making sure it's ok? That is, managed to stop and start without errors in its logs?

Thanks!
Also, you can use the workaround in the doc text of bug 1167801 which you linked at, which suggests to run on engine db:

UPDATE dwh_history_timekeeping SET var_value = 0 WHERE var_name = "DwhCurrentlyRunning";

This will most probably work for you.

Sorry, that should be with single quotes:

UPDATE dwh_history_timekeeping SET var_value = 0 WHERE var_name = 'DwhCurrentlyRunning';
A restart of dwhd and reportsd was enough to make the upgrade go through. No need to update that table. Maybe the error message can suggest a restart, or have logic to ssh in and do the restart for the user? Thanks for the help!
We have bug 1150402 for ssh to the dwh machine, which turned out to be a bit more complex than expected and postponed for now.

I added some text to the wiki [1], which will hopefully be picked up by search engines soon, and be enough for other similar cases.

I am now closing this bug. Please reopen if relevant.

Thanks for the report!
