This was fixed with upstream commit 3f7352bf21f8fd7ba3e2fcef9488756f188e12be.  That was contained in the 4.1-rc6 release.  It was backported to the 4.0.6 stable kernel release with commit cba191a815fcc2634022fb8e0a7410c16adf9ced.

Both F21 and F22 already have 4.0.6 released as stable update.  Rawhide is on the 4.2 merge window.  This bug is already fixed in all active Fedora branches.
