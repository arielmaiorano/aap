Additional info:
Hello,

You also need to install qt5-translations, qt-creator is coded in such way that if the Qt5 translations are missing, then it won't list it's own translations since the result would be incomplete.

I suppose to make this more obvious to users, I could create a new qt-creator-translations package which would carry a dependency on qt5-translations. Would that help?
Hello.

Yes, I think it's good solution.
