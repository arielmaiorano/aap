Description of problem:
When doing bulk introspection, the user sees messages about sending all nodes to introspection, waiting for introspection to complete, and the user gets feedback that everything worked (or not).

On the other hand, when introspecting a single node, the command doesn't print anything and just exits immediately. How do I know if it succeeded?


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
python-rdomanager-oscplugin-0.0.8-13.el7ost.noarch


How reproducible:
100%


Steps to Reproduce:
1. For example: openstack baremetal introspection start ef554f96-4cb9-47a8-a138-c2e082905b80


Actual results:
Nothing is shown


Expected results:
Same feedback as you would get from doing a bulk introspection
