+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1233258 +++

Description of problem:

When a fop starts a subfop as part of its own execution, it's possible that this subfop finishes before the manager has completed the processing of the current state. In this case ec_resume() is called and a new instance of the same state machine is executed by another thread.

This could cause multiple problems.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): mainline

    cluster/ec: Avoid parallel executions of the same state machine
    
            Backport of http://review.gluster.org/11317
    
    In very rare circumstances it was possible that a subfop started
    by another fop could finish fast enough to cause that two or more
    instances of the same state machine be executing at the same time.
