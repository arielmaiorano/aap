i386 installboot had a sign extension bug which prevented proper bootblock
initialization when the root filesystem was placed beyond 4GB.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.4/i386/installboot.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
Unfortunately, updated 2.4 install floppies are not available.  Just ensure
that your root filesystem is below 4GB, for now.
