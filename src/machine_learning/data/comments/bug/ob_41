Various OpenSSH improvements have been made since the 2.6 release shipped.<br>
To resolve the various (non-security related) features which users may want,
we are making a jumbo patch available.  <strong>This is now at VERSION FOUR.</strong><br>

Revision 4 of this jumbo source code patch exists.</a><br>
<strong>NOTE: /etc/sshd_config and /etc/ssh_config may need changes.</strong>
