Description of problem:
I can choose the + when setting the requires_doc_text flag, but, after saving the bug, I'm told by bugzilla that "Only members of the ecs group can change the requires_doc_text flag to '+'". The flag should *not* be available to me to choose.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
4.4.9032-3


How reproducible:


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be a non-ECS member and choose '+' in the requires_doc_text field.
2. Save the bug.
3. Observe the error message.


Actual results:
As a non-ECS member, I can choose the flag.


Expected results:
As a non-ECS member, I cannot choose the flag.
To implement the ECS flag rules requires a lot of special logic that subverts the normal bugzilla flag rules.

Having the + flag state visible when you normally couldn't set it is a side effect of this customization and can't be fixed.
