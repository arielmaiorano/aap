rhcert on rhel 6 uses systemtd.  On rhel 6.6. it should use init.

RHEL 6.6
redhat-certification-1.0-20150624.el6.noarch
redhat-certification-hardware-1.6.6-20150619.el6.noarch

reliably reproducible

1. create a new certification on a system with python-virtinst (the equivalent of virt-install).
2. run fv_core (or other fv_* tests.
3. check output when fv_ test starts

expected behavior is that the fv_ test cause rhcert to restart using `service libvirtd restart`, which causes the test to continue.
