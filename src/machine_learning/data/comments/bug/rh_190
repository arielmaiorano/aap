# Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

GNOME Web (Epiphany) 3.16.2
WebKitGtk 2.8.3

# Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open https://www.flickr.com/search
2. Try to select a filter (license, SafeSearch, whatever).

# Actual results:

Nothing happens.

# Expected results:

A "PopOver" should appear, allowing you to filter your search.
I see in the web inspector:

TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.Plugin.Host')

Most likely a flickr bug.
