I'm not even running MATE desktop, I have no idea why Caja loads itself a doszen times every time I login.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1240308 ***
This is a different bug. Caja loads a dozen times on login with NO user intervention. It is NOT a duplicate. of 1240308!
Do you really use caja for session start in xfce!!!!
Caja is develop for mate-desktop and not for using it with session start in xfce.
Why did you that?
And why do you expect that this will work.
Caja needs more other components for session start which aren't in xfce.
Sorry, this isn't a bug
It is impossible to replace thunar with caja for xfce.
Try out mate.
No I DO NOT use caja at startup. It is loading itself without my intervention. It is really annoying. I've removed mate. Problem solved. Thanks for not understanding.
Normaly, caja doesn't start at session login in other desktops because /usr/share/applications/caja.desktop has this entry
OnlyShowIn=MATE

This means this desktop file is only vissible in mate session.

Your description is very short and implement that you use caja for session start.
Please beware that you not the only one that files out reports which i've to answer.
A good description with more than one sentence helps us to understand better what the prob is.
