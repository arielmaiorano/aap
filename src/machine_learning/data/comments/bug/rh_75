Description of problem:
Currently the firefox srpm bundles a source rpm for GCC so that it can build a sufficiently modern compiler for the latest firefox.  This process could be replaced via use of the devtoolset-3 compiler.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
firefox-38.1.0-1.el6_6.src.rpm

How reproducible:100%


Steps to Reproduce:
1.recompile firefox source
2.watch it build gcc
3.watch it build python2.7

Actual results:
builds compiler and interpreter already packed by RH

Expected results:
scl enable devtoolset-3 python27

Additional info:
The python27 software collection can supplant the python build as well.
Devtoolset miss support for second arches (ppc, s390) so we can't use it.
