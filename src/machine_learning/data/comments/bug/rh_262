Hi,

it would be nice to have a smartproxy for infoblox ipam.

Actually we evaluate IPAM Systems and we prefer infoblox IPAM. Here we will manage v4 and v6 blocks. 
An usecase will be. 

# Foreman create a vm, ask vmware for mac address
# sends data (hostname and mac) to ipam
# gets next ip address (v4 and/or v6)
