Bind IPv6 address was works:
[mikhail@localhost ~]$ telnet 127.0.0.1 12345
Trying 127.0.0.1...
^C
[mikhail@localhost ~]$ telnet ::1 12345
Trying ::1...
Connected to ::1.

Why do you fill bug on openssh, if you claim that this happened after last update and openssh is not in the list of updated packages?

Unfortunately I can't reproduce your failure with my updated Fedora 22. Can you have a look if you don't have some selinux denial in audit?
# ausearch -m AVC -ts recent

If you specify -4 option, will it fail the forwarding completely? It looks like somehow wrong configured machine ...
$ ssh -4 -D12345 crmdev@81.30.214.93 -p 21212 -vvv
Seems to be related to NM bug:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1234121

Can you retest with previous version of NM to make sure it is this one? If so I will close it as duplicate.
Yes it related to NM bug, I know.
