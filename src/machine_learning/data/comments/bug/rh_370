Description of problem:Detection of gesture of more than one finger has became worst with the libinput 0.18 update. Example of gesture would be two finger scrolling, before the update it detects fine but after the update it often register it as is I place the cursor using another finger when I already have one finger on the touchpad


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 0.18


How reproducible:Very 


Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open anything that can be scrolled (a website)
2.Use two finger to scroll down the page like you used to before the update
3.Observe the decreased sensitivity in two finger detection/algorithm

Actual results: Wonky scrolling half of the time


Expected results: Flawless gesture detection as before the 0.18 update

The evemu-record file requested

Here is the file requested, there are some cases of the issue appearing, but there are also cases where the two finger scrolling works as expected being recorded. Feel free to let me know if you only need one that when the gesture didn't work.

Updated evemu-record file

This is a new one, with most of the event recorded being the glitched one.
