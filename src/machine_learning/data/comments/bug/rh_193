21

How reproducible:

Steps to Reproduce:

2. (app needs libssl to build or run)

error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
ARG-V! Is there a way to link openssl -> ssl? Seems package confusion is running amok here.Libssl is disguised as openssl-devel.This may help someone else with other packages as well.
