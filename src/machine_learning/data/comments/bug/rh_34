it looks like an ACPI bug in the actual kernel
currently i use the actual kernel 4.0.6
and on this Bug you can find this problem again on fedora 21.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1184273
Does blacklisting dw_dmac and dw_dmac_core fix it as mentioned in bug 1184273?
can you tell me how i can do that?
sry i am a newcomer
iÂ´ ve solved the problem by doing:

echo "blacklist dw_dmac" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist dw_dmac_core" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

and the Bug is gone :-)

The netbook is now rebooting / shutting down correctly

It look like that the kernel modules are broken
