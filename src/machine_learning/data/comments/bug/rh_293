Description of problem:
The openstack-config tool now executes crudini, which has more options than openstack-config had. However, the openstack-config man page still only mentions the original options, so for instance --list, which can be used to update a list of values, is missing. Consequently, anyone who wants to become familiar with openstack-config by reading the man page will be missing the actual possibilities.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
openstack-utils-2014.2-1.el7ost.noarch

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. man openstack-config

Actual results:
Outdated openstack-config man page.

Expected results:
The crudini man page.
Well really this command is deprecated and provided for compat.
It's better to use crudini directly. I've now mentioned that in the man page:

I wonder if you could modify the man page differently. For instance, you could use .so man1/crudini.1 to make man load the crudini man page. See http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Man-Page/q4.html for more information. (I wouldn't vote for a symlink because some rpm validators don't like dangling symlinks.)
Good suggestion, though then there would be no opportunity to state that openstack-config is deprecated, so users might just add crudini options to the openstack-config command? Also most man page readers make it trivial to load the crudini(1) reference
