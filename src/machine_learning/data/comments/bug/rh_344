Description of problem: Main menu was OK, but degenerated - 3 lower icons are now just "terminal" images.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Fedora 22: cinnamon most current (dnf updated ALL yesterday = 6/29/2015) -
  running vmlinuz-4.0.6-300.fc22.x86_64


How reproducible: 100%


Steps to Reproduce:
1. use cinnamon - click on main menu (lower bottom corner)
2. first 3 icons work right (text RIGHT), but appear now as terminals
3.

Actual results: icons for lower three main menu - left side are terminals - text with them is right (quit, logout, lockscreen from bottom)


Expected results: Yesterday these had their own icons.


Additional info: tried to screenshot, but could not keep menu up for menu-screenshot and my prior trick with a shell script failed miserably - gnome-screenshot is making a file with a prematuree EOF.

You have changed icon theme (to fedora icons) and it doesn't have the shutdown, logout and lockscreen icons.
humble apologies. who knew? back to adwaita

I was trying something for another bug - someone requested I change some themes (not that one) and I was trying things out.
