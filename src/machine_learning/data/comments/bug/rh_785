Description of problem:
On every page has to be downloaded insights.js - 60000 LOC, 3 MB file, even if Insights is not enabled. Causing regression - page anchors don't work.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):


How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Insights disabled
2. Go to $SAT/rhn/apidoc/handlers/SystemHandler.jsp#getEntitlements

Actual results:
insights.js is downloaded despite disabled service, anchor does not work because URL is malformed

Expected results:
insights.js is not required and page anchor works
Insights.js must be loaded on each page. There is no way to determine if Insights is enabled otherwise. The page anchors not working was due to angular-ui-router being mis-configured. It is fixed in redhat-access-plugin-sat5-1.0.4-15.el6.

It's better now, if you click on link you will get on requested anchor but there is still redundant '/' slash in URL. (e.g. '/rhn/apidoc/handlers/SlaveHandler.jsp#/update'). So if you refresh page you will not be navigated to the same place.

I do not agree here. Satellite serves over 630 pages. Pages really needed to run insights.js are how many - 10? The amount of pages that need to run the js is simply too low to burden all the pages with that specific script.

There is always a better solution.
Yes, with unlimited time we could solve a lot of problems. I agree loading the script on every page is unnecessary given there is no caching in place. For the GA release I will create a lightweight loader.js script which will simply determine if more code needs to be pulled in to the browser. loader.js will run on every page.
Verified.

Thank you. Do you need a separate BZ to track and properly QA the change?
Yes that would be great. I've made the changes, they will be in the next build.

Thanks, I opened Bug 1238743 for that purpose.
