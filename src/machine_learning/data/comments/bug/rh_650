Description of problem:
My first Problem was: I can't start (no more) my VM via KVM (virt-manager)
I search arround, found a HowTo on fedoraprojekt. I install "yum install @virtualization" and reboot
caja and also mate-notification hangs - my Menue in Mate Desktop hangs
a new reboot (hard reset!) and after the hard reset ABRT came up 

Version-Release number of selected component:
mate-notification-daemon-1.10.0-1.fc22
