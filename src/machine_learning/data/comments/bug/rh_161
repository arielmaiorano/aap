This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.
This broken package is not worth the effort to fix. The upstream has moved to making it a Unity component, it no longer works without the Ubuntu glue.

As shown here:

https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/gwibber/

I have orphaned and retired this in rawhide.
