Section Number and Name: 
"Table 1.3. Required Network Ports" and possibly procedure below would need to be updated as well.


Describe the issue:
To make NoVNC console functional, you have to open tcp ports from 5910 to to 5930.


Suggestions for improvement: 
These ports are missing in the table. IMO they can be in "Optional" section.
Since this issue was entered in Red Hat Bugzilla, the release flag has been
set to ? to ensure that it is properly evaluated for this release.
Thank you Jan,

I am going to close this bug as a dup of 1226727, since that one is for changes to the required network ports section... I have also added your comments there. 

We should be able to get this taken care of for the next release of the docs. Please follow 1226727 for updates. 


Regards,
Hayley Hudgeons
