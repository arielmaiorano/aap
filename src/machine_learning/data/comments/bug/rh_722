Description of problem:
The alert popped up immediately after logging in and X server and DT manager were up.
SELinux is preventing /usr/bin/python2.7 from 'add_name' accesses on the directory .

*****  Plugin catchall (100. confidence) suggests   **************************

If you believe that python2.7 should be allowed add_name access on the  directory by default.
Then you should report this as a bug.
You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
Do
allow this access for now by executing:
# grep python /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
# semodule -i mypol.pp
