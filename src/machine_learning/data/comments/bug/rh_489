Description of problem:  Resuming a docked notebook won't change it's output to the external monitor.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gnome-settings-daemon-3.16.2-1.fc22.x86_64

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Undock the notebook (no external monitors are atteched to it)
2. Put it to sleep;
3. Dock the notebook (closed lid);
4. Wake the notebook (external monitor is connected to the docking station).

Actual results:
The output isn't switched, so I can't see the GDM.

Expected results:
Switch outputs.
I fixed this issue in Cinnamon, (c-s-d) by:

Closing this cause I prefer to track bugs in a single place.
