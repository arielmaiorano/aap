Description of problem:
There are some reports from the FSF that Linus is releasing non-free kernels by default and there is movement to fix this.Unfortunately by doing so hardware that is non-free(what isnt non-free these days) is broken or fails with this type of install.Not all of us can afford to do our homework when buying a PC or have Linux in mind initially when buying PC components.

My ROG/AMD 9590 combination is perfect example.Sata controller isnt ICH by defalt.
Video drivers usually must be non-free to get things like opencl to work.Fedora has gotten around this obstacle.Wireless drivers are known to break when doing this.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Fedora as a whole

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
Run ISO or install Linux.

Actual results:
Are we free or non-free? Some distros dont care about the kernel and focus more on packages.

Expected results:
Shouldnt Fedora be FREE? (or is this asking too much?) Maybe Linus needs some more COFFEE so he can wake up.
