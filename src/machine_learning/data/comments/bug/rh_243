non-free kickstart for spin

Description of problem:
similar to Bug 1204444. Repos used for building the kickstart ISO are not being put properly in /etc/yum.repos.d/. I noticed this when fixing a Tor bug I had where I pulled it from fedora-updates instead of the torproject repos.Half of my repos are missing that I used for the install.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
21

How reproducible:
not sure. Just noticed this.Didnt seem to happen before.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. spin fedora
2. look at /etc/yum.repos.d/
3. compare to kickstart file

Actual results:
some .repo files are missing.

Expected results:
The repo files should be there.Not getting 404 or other errors which would be preventing this.Install otherwise proceeds as normal.

Additional info:
files have been properly relocated for 22 but Im using 21.
