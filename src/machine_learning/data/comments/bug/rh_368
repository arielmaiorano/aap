Description of problem:

The "dialog_" prefix for generic dialog attributes was removed in a prior PR.

Change caused the issue described below:  
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1235975

Fix to put back the "dialog_": 
https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/pull/3312

The catalogiteminitialization/catalogbundleinitialization methods need to be modified to look for the dialog prefixed attributes to override the service_name, service_description, and vm_name.
Modified dialog_parsing code, so this is not an issue.
