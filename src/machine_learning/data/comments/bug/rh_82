Description of problem:

tDOM require expat. While building, it uses expat.h and nametab.h headers. Both were bundled along with full expat library, what is wrong. expat.h is shipped by expat-devel but nametab.h - not.

How reproducible:
Try to build tDOM without bundled expat library.

Actual results:
In file included from ./generic/xmlsimple.c:69:0:
./generic/dom.h:249:30: fatal error:nametab.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

Expected results:
Building complete.
nametab.h is not part of the expat public API, it's an internal interface.

$ head -1 expat-2.1.0/lib/nametab.h 
static const unsigned namingBitmap[] = {
...
^ note, static.
Yes, static.
S.o tDOM have to use bundled one.
