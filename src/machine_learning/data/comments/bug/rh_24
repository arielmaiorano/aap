I'm looking at lvm2 git, not sure if this is in even rawhide yet...

In the "tag config" section of the lvm.conf manpage, it defines the order that configuration values are searched-for. lvmlocal.conf should be added to this list. I'm assuming it's searched before lvm.conf, but it's not intuitive what the ordering of lvmlocal.conf vs lvm_<tag>.conf might be, for example.
Yes.

The template file supplied states:

# The lvmlocal.conf file is normally expected to contain only the
# "local" section which contains settings that should not be shared or
# repeated among different hosts.  (But if other sections are present,
# they *will* get processed.  Settings in this file override equivalent
# ones in lvm.conf and are in turn overridden by ones in any enabled
# lvm_<tag>.conf files.)
thanks, I updated lvm.conf accordingly, closing.
lvm.conf manpage, I meant.

oops, disregard. I told bodhi the wrong bug for something else...
