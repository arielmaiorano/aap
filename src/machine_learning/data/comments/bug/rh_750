Additional info:
Here is my instackenv.json:


{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "pm_password": "calvin",
      "pm_type": "pxe_ipmitool",
      "mac": [
        "a0:2b:b8:1f:be:40"
      ],
      "pm_user": "root",
      "pm_addr": "10.9.10.109"
    },
    {
      "pm_password": "calvin",
      "pm_type": "pxe_ipmitool",
      "mac": [
        "a0:2b:b8:1f:c0:fc"
      ],
      "pm_user": "root",
      "pm_addr": "10.9.10.110"
    },
    {
      "pm_password": "calvin",
      "pm_type": "pxe_ipmitool",
      "mac": [
        "a0:2b:b8:1f:c0:34"
      ],
      "pm_user": "root",
      "pm_addr": "10.9.10.111"
    },
    {
      "pm_password": "calvin",
      "pm_type": "pxe_ipmitool",
      "mac": [
        "a0:2b:b8:1f:ba:dc"
      ],
      "pm_user": "root",
      "pm_addr": "10.9.10.112"
    }
  ]
}
When I added this to each stanza, the command worked:

"cpu":"2",
"memory":"4096",
"disk":"40",
"arch":"x86_64",

I didn't think these values were actually required any more, but perhaps they are. The error message could be much better, and not only because of the deprecation error. ERROR: 'cpu' doesn't tell me that I need to specify the minimum number of cpus.
We are using os-cloud-config to actually do the heavy lifting here[1], and it requires these keys in the json[2]. I think it would be good to make them optional, but that is not the current state of things.

As far as the error, it certainly could and should be improved. I think this error is also bubbling up from os-cloud-config.
