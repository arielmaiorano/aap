Description of problem:
I was digging around to find the SELinux enabling command for user Private folders and I came across this from an Ubuntu user.This probably affects Debian and Fedora teams as well.Will format this into 'bug format' for Debian, I have a few unposted bugs from my last install awaiting to be sent out.

ecryptfs has a hashing problem.

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2524-1
March 11, 2015

ecryptfs-utils vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 14.10
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

Summary:

Sensitive information in encrypted home and Private directories could be
exposed if an attacker gained access to your files.

Software Description:
- ecryptfs-utils: eCryptfs cryptographic filesystem utilities

Details:

Sylvain Pelissier discovered that eCryptfs did not generate a random salt when
encrypting the mount passphrase with the login password. An attacker could use
this issue to discover the login password used to protect the mount passphrase
and gain unintended access to the encrypted files.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 14.10:
  ecryptfs-utils                  104-0ubuntu1.14.10.3
  libecryptfs0                    104-0ubuntu1.14.10.3

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
  ecryptfs-utils                  104-0ubuntu1.14.04.3
  libecryptfs0                    104-0ubuntu1.14.04.3

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
  ecryptfs-utils                  96-0ubuntu3.4
  libecryptfs0                    96-0ubuntu3.4

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  ecryptfs-utils                  83-0ubuntu3.2.10.04.6
  libecryptfs0                    83-0ubuntu3.2.10.04.6

After a standard system update you need to log out of all sessions and then log
back in to make all the necessary changes.

==============================

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
20+, possibly RHEL7+ also

How reproducible:
according to this article, every attempt to encrypt mount passphrase

Steps to Reproduce:
To get the mount passphrase, you have to issue:
ecryptfs-setup-private

(ecryptfs-utils package needs to be installed)

Actual results:
see test results above

Expected results:
we should hash this better. we have fixed bugs like this before in the past.Im betting latest source package contains the fix for this.Need to include that in recent distros such as fc20+.

Looks like the sources are here: http://ecryptfs.org/source.html
Not an issue in RHEL7; we don't ship ecryptfs in RHEL7.
