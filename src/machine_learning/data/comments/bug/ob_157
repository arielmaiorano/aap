Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mprotect&amp;sektion=2">mprotect(2)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mmap&amp;sektion=2">mmap(2)</a>
requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
