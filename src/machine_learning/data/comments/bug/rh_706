Description of problem: One more option would be SUPER. The ability to remove (expunge) all trash older than some day would be great (suggest 30, 60, 90 days) - this should be a manual thing. Deleting ALL manually is not a great option.

Thanks for a bug report. This is reported upstream already [1], thus I'm closing this in a favour of it. Please see [1] for any further updates.

I suggested this a long time ago, but most of these suggestions were lost in the Fedora 20 eulogy.

One other thing that would work just as well as the above named options is:

  In the Trash folder, change the option "delete" to "expunge" and mean it.
  Deleting from trash should mean expunge IMHO.

That's [2], but still the same issue, selective expunge is not straight possible in IMAP (it can be worked around, but it has its caveats).

OK, I tried to find another way. Thanks - hope you can put some way to do this in the future. Thanks all.
