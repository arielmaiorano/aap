Description of problem:
Wildcard downgrade multiple packages worked with yum, but looks like dnf is trying to downgrade not to packages name, but it's name extended by EVR.
It doesn't make sense to downgrade to same version, downgrade should install older version of package.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
dnf-1.0.1-2.fc22.noarch

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install some php packages
2. dnf downgrade php\*

Actual results:
[root@work ~]# dnf downgrade php\*                                   [1242/1290]
