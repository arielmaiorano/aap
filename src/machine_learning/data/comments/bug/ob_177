Some older BIOSes are unable to boot CD1 (ie. the commercial release sold
by the project, not the CD images available on the net).
A workaround using CD2 (amd64 architecture) is as follows.
(An amd64 machine is <i>NOT</i> required for this to work.)<br>
<br>

<ol>
<li>Insert CD2 and tell your computer to boot it;<br>
<li>When the <tt>boot></tt> prompt appears, stop the automatic boot
by pressing the space bar;<br>
<li>Remove CD2 and insert CD1;<br>
<li>Erase the character you typed to stop the boot, type<br>
<tt><b>boot /4.2/i386/bsd.rd</b></tt><br>
then press <i>Enter</i>.
</ol>
