On very high system load, an audio interrupt may occur while the
audio process is filling audio ring buffers. This triggers bogus
(and useless) correction code in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=audio&sektion=4">audio(4)</a>
driver causing the audio application to go out of sync, and in turn causing
continuous stuttering until the application is restarted.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
