Description of problem:
When installing fedora-upgrade, I automatically get rpmfusion-nonfree keys installed.
While I can agree to rpmfusion-free (reluctantly), I'm not sure -nonfree keys should be in here, as I think Fedora is not supposed to facilitate downloading nonfree software.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
fedora-upgrade-22.2-1.fc21

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install fedora-upgrade
2. rpm -ql fedora-upgrade

Additional info:
Note the missing rpmfusion keys in my expected results.

Why?
That is just GPG keys. They alone are not covered by any license, patents. That is free data.

Fedora already facilitate usage of nonfree data/sw: see lpf, autodownloader.
It just not include it directly in main distribution.

IMHO it is NOTABUG, but I'm open to discussion.
In this specific case, the inclusion of these GPG keys was determined to not be a legal issue. Leaving the bug CLOSED->NOTABUG.
