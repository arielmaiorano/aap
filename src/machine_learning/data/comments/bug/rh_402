Description of problem:
I added a build. Maybe the bug was triggered by the fact that I called 'copr cancel' on another build at about the same time from another terminal?

Version-Release number of selected component:
copr-cli-1.44-1.fc22

reporter:       libreport-2.6.0
cmdline:        /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/copr-cli build nalimilan/julia-nightlies http://nalimilan.fedorapeople.org/julia-0.4.0-0.20150628.fc22.src.rpm

Hello Milan,
thank you for the feedback.

More likely there was some external problem with the connection and your client was just timed out. I think that error message is correct output in this kind of situation. BUT, you definitely should get more user-friendly message instead of the traceback.


Anyway, this report is duplicate of 1194522 so I would like to ask you to watch progress about the issue there.
