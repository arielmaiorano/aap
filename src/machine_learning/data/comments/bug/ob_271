httpd was developed very rapidly in the weeks before 5.6 release, and
it has a few flaws.  It would be nice to get these flaws fully
remediated before the next release, and that requires the community to
want to use it.  Therefore here is a "jumbo" patch that brings in the
most important fixes.

<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.6/common/009_httpd.patch.sig">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
<br>
<i>Unfortunately the source tree found on the CD set contains a slightly different
checkout, from just before the release was finished and is missing a few httpd
commits. Therefore, the patch above will not apply correctly. Users are encouraged
to use cvs to get the latest httpd sources if interested.</i>
