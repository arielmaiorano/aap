We would like to be able to rename a disk once created. 

> What are your business requirements for wanting to rename a VM's disk?

Being able to have "good" disks names makes it easier to manage disks, particularly when a disk is detached from it's VM and we don't know where it belonged anymore. This is even more important when using VM templates because disks created by templates all share the same name, which makes it impossible to differentiate them from each other when detached.

Right-click on the disk, Rename.

Yes
There currently is no way to edit a disk without a vm/template context to it (see bug 1080097).
Making this happen requires moving WAY too much code around, and isn't in scope for 3.6.0.
Let's reconsider for 4.0.0.

Current available workaround for the customer:
From a VM's Disks subtab you can edit the disk, where you can set its name/alias/description
