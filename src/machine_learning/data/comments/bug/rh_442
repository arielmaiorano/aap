run-crons-script-prefix.patch

Description of problem:
When scripts are executed from cron.* directories, the mailed output is mixed up. It is hard to say which output applies to each script.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
1.5.0

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some scripts to cron.* dirs which produce output.
2. Wait until cronie executes these scripts.
3. Check mail.

Actual results:
Concatenated output of all scripts.

Expected results:
Output from various scripts should distinguished.

Additional info:
I attach a simple patch solving the problem.
Where are you getting the run_crons script from? It is not part of cronie or crontabs packages.
Sorry, I haven't checked to which package run-crons belongs. It is not cronie, indeed...
