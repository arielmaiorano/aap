Description of problem:

Large number of alerts for same event.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

3.5.0-0.32.el6ev

How reproducible:

100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For a cluster with 1 host, enable HA reservations
2. Wait :-)
3.

Actual results:

Every 10 minutes, event 10300 (CLUSTER_ALERT_HA_RESERVATION) is raised (Cluster cluster_name failed the HA Reservation check, HA VMs on host(s): host_name will fail to migrate in case of a failover, consider adding resources or shutting down unused VMs.)

Expected results:

A) "Enable HA Reservation" to be grayed out if only 1 eligible host in cluster
B) Event to be raised only once, not every 10 minutes

Additional info:

A user-friendly way of selecting multiple Alerts and dismissing them would be nice.

Hi Thom,
this is working by design;
The system is warning you that in case of a failure you will not have
capacity for HA. With a single host this is obvious, still the alert is valid.
Consider a scenario where you have 2 hosts and one goes down.

If you do not want to use HA reservations, you can disable it using:
Cluster-> Edit cluster
Cluster Policy-> Disable "Enable HA Reservation"
