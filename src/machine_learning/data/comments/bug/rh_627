There are some warnings I'd like to see fixed, esp. the errors:
- openstack-manila-ui.noarch: E: non-executable-script /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/manila_ui/dashboards/project/__init__.py 0644L /usr/bin/env
- openstack-manila-ui.noarch: E: non-executable-script /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/manila_ui/dashboards/project/config.py 0644L /usr/bin/env
If possible, please include a check section, too.
spec + src.rpm updated
* fixed all the errors
* added a %check section, tests are disabled by default as they need a working manila installation. Could be enabled using --with tests
Thank you.

Next time, please bump release, add a changelog and put new links to spec and srpm.


Tests still seem to be run independently from manila (and even from horizon)
