Description of problem:

Currently virt-v2v cannot convert RHEL 7 guests, unless you
manually install libguestfs-xfs (XFS support for libguestfs).

virt-v2v should just Require libguestfs-xfs, which avoids
this problem.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

libguestfs-1.28.1-1.44.el7

How reproducible:

100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install virt-v2v and ensure libguestfs-xfs is NOT installed.
2. Try a virt-v2v conversion of a RHEL 7 guest (which uses XFS
as its default filesystem).

Actual results:

Will fail because it cannot inspect the RHEL 7 guest.

Works if you install libguestfs-xfs and retry the conversion.
I've just realized that this bug description is completely wrong.
virt-v2v works fine, even without libguestfs-xfs installed.

The dependency from virt-v2v -> libguestfs-xfs is not needed.
