mizdebsk's apache-commons-parent-38-1.fc23 completed http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=665042
Fixed in apache-commons-parent-38-1
I believe that this feature is included in apache-commons-parent-38-1,
which is available in Fedora Rawhide, so I am closing this bug now.

The build which includes the feature can be found at Koji:
