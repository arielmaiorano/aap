The MacOS installer shipped with OpenBSD 2.7 does not correctly make all
devices, specifically it does not make the <tt>/dev/arandom</tt> device
needed for the userland crypto such as ssh to work.  The problem shows itself
when ssh-keygen fails to make RSA or DSA keys, resulting in messages like
<b>RSA-generate_keys failed</b> or <b>DSA-generate_keys failed</b>.

To work around this, once your machine is up and running run the following
commands as root:
<pre>
# cd /dev
# ./MAKEDEV arandom
</pre>
