Description of problem:

Based on an email request:

> I hit a case where I required /etc/pulp/*conf files and I realized neither sosreport or foreman-debug collect them. Do you think either tool should gather them?


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

* Satellite 6.1.0

How reproducible:

Additional info:
this should have been working

https://github.com/Katello/katello/blob/master/deploy/script/katello-debug.sh

Works for me with the latest compose:

foreman-debug -g -a -d /tmp/test
find /tmp/test | grep pulp
/tmp/test/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp.conf
/tmp/test/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp_docker.conf
...

Note this is only collected when this package is present:

[root@hp-sl2x170zg6-01 ~]# rpm -q katello-debug
katello-debug-2.2.0.11-1.el7sat.noarch
[root@hp-sl2x170zg6-01 ~]# rpm -ql katello-debug
/usr/share/foreman/script/foreman-debug.d/katello-debug.sh

It should be present by default for Capsules.

So the question is - what kind if deployment is it?·

I noticed it on Sat6.0 as missing. Confirmed both upstream and 6.1 beta collect the configs properly due to:

https://github.com/Katello/katello/blob/master/deploy/script/katello-debug.sh#L44

closing as fixed in 6.1 beta.
