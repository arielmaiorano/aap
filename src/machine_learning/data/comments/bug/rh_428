Description of problem: When an ImageStream's spec.dockerImageRepository is set to registry.access.redhat.com/library/rhel, it's not able to import the tags and images due to an error.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 3.0.0


How reproducible: 100%


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an image stream with spec.dockerImageRepository set to registry.access.redhat.com/library/rhel
2. Wait a few seconds for the image import controller to process the stream

Actual results: no tags/images imported, and the image stream has this annotation: 	openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=could not convert image: &errors.errorString{s:"expected pointer, but got nil"}


Expected results: tags/images are imported


Additional info:

There is 1 image in the rhel repo that does not have a Config section. While it is optional, OpenShift currently requires it.
Check on puddle [3.0.1/2015-06-26.1]

1.  Create an image stream with spec.dockerImageRepository set to registry.access.redhat.com/library/rhel
