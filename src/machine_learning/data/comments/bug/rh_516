Description of problem:
Logrotate can't rotate syslog files properly. They are renamed, bug rsyslog is not restarted. Looks like problem is in /etc/logrotate.d/syslog file, which is trying to HUP kill /var/run/syslogd.pid instead of  /var/run/rsyslogd.pid.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
rsyslog-8.8.0-2.fc22.x86_64

How reproducible:
weekly (always on rotation)

Additional info:
Consider changing /etc/logrotate/syslog to /etc/logrotate/rsyslog too, but may be only in Fedora 23. For Fedora 22 this could cause problems if somebody modified this file.
