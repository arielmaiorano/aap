Additional info:
Thank you for the bug report!

What version of abrt, libreport and gnome-abrt do you have?

Run '$ rpm -q abrt libreport gnome-abrt' to get the versions.
Could you also connect to the "abrt-bodhi" process with "strace" and provide the output here?

Run '$ strace -o abrt-bodhi.log -p $ABRT_BODHI_PID' (In your case the abrt-bodhi process PID was 26018, so the strace command would be as follows: '$ strace -o abrt-bodhi.log -p 26018').

After connecting to the bodhi process wait a minute and after that detach the strace by pressing "Ctrl+C". The required output is in abrt-bodhi.log.
System is been update, and new version abrt installed.
abrt-2.3.0-7.fc21.x86_64
libreport-2.3.0-8.fc21.x86_64
gnome-abrt-1.0.0-3.fc21.x86_64

In new version abrt i have not error.

I reproduce crash in gconf-edior and abrt work fine, without endless loop.
I can`t repeat error with gvfs, be—Åouse all error in abrt is clean
Closing as CURRENTRELEASE per comment #3.

Thank you! Please feel free to reopen if needed.
