Description of problem:
I can't unlock a locked session on mate.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
mate-screensaver-1.10.1-2.fc23.i686

How reproducible:
Happens everytime I try to reproduce it


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 20150704 Nightly Rawhide (Mate i686 spin) inside a qemu-kvm guest
2. Log in as user in a graphical session
3. Press the button 'Lock Screen', from the menu 'System'
4. Type the correct password inside the dialog
5. Press the appropriate button to unlock

Actual results:
The screen remains locked

Expected results:
The screen should be unlocked, since the password is correct.

Additional info:
Is it an issue related to virtualization?
I don't know.
Please use stable releases and not rawhide a month after f22 release.
Sorry, i'm the only mate maintainer in fedora and i don't start to work on rawhide reports before f23 beta :)
I'm not a redhat employee and all i do for mate in fedora is in my free time.
closed because of fake email address
Sorry, I didn't understand.

Which email address are you talking about?

Run

killall mate-screensaver
mate-screensaver --debug

reproduce the issue and post the terminal error here, you may need to kill the screensaver from another VT to get back in.
Also post .xsession-errors
@All: I've just found that abrt catches the issue ("mate-screensaver-dialog killed by SIGSEGV") and so it might provide interesting information. I'm sorry I haven't noticed it before. Here's the link of the retrace: https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/reports/bthash/77b7d2e726e67e7a33746771875f67144b49e454

I'm posting some attachments, but feel free to ask me further.

@Leigh: thank you for your comment, I'll provide the requested bits in a while.

@Wolfgang: I'm just doing release validation testing for Fedora QA. Nobody forces you to fix this bug promptly, because Mate is not a release blocking desktop. But I'd suggest not to close this report, otherwise we'll probably forget about the issue before F23 beta reaches the light.
