This is happening every time I try to start Evolution. Suggestions on how to debug/workaround this are welcome as I would really like to access my email again.
Thanks for a bug report. Could you verify what was updated, please? The backtrace shows that the load of libXcursor.so.1 fails, I do not see/understand why exactly, either the file is broken, or has a wrong architecture, or is built with incorrect flags, or... I do not see the exact reason in the backtrace, just that it failed when opening this library, which is caused by a cursor load in the evolution. This cursor load cannot be disabled. Try to upgrade/downgrade/reinstall libXcursor package, though there do not seem to be any updates for it.
Does Firefox crash for you as well? If I recall it correctly this happened to me when I updated from F20 to F21 and in the end I had to re-install my system.
I ran "rpm -Va" and reviewed the output. The only relevant line was this:

..5......    /usr/lib64/libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0.so.18.1.10

It seems this file maybe got corrupt somehow. I then ran "dnf reinstall webkitgtk4" and now evolution is starting fine.

Thanks for your help with this, seems that it was file corruption and not a bug.
Nice, I'm closing this as such. Thanks. Interestingly, evolution doesn't use webkitgtk4, it uses webkitgtk3.
Yes you are right. That is seriously weird. evo failed to start a hundred times over several days and reboots before I ran that dnf reinstall and has started fine a dozen times since so it fixed it somehow.

"dnf remove webkitgtk4" tries to remove evolution so it is connected somehow, but ldd and strace -f show only the version 3 in use.

Have to add that to the "life's mysteries box" I think.
