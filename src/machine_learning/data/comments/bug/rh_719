redhat-certification does not see tests, and prints a complaint about incorrect function arguments when run with --debug=high

redhat-certification-1.0-20150618.el6.noarch
redhat-certification-hardware-1.6.6-20150619.el6.noarch

stress-0.18.8-1.3.EL6.x86_64


How reproducible:
reliably.  looking for first occurance to determine when regression occurred, and workarounds.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install redhat-certification and redhat-certification-hardware
2. run `rhcert-backend --debug=high plan` OR
3. register the host as an SUT for itself as LTS
4. attach the host to a hardware certification
5. click "continue" to go to the test results page and launch tests

Actual results:
CLI will complain like this:
# rhcert-backend --debug=high plan
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/rhcert/crypto.py:16: DeprecationWarning: the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead
  import os, md5, M2Crypto, magic

saved test plan to /var/rhcert/results.xml

The web ui will not list tests.  Additionally, /var/log/rhcert disappears when the host is attached to the certification.



Expected results:
redhat-certification sees the -hardware tests, and either plans them in the CLI or displays them in the web ui.  Logs should not disappear.  If a tail -f is running on the logs, no new information is printed.

Additional info:
Services provided by lmbench for network testing are not started with the server, and no output is given for them indicating an attempted start.
Statement about tail -f in Expected results above belongs under Additional info
there's a mix of complaints about python2.6 and python2.7
I see some python2.7 listed in the above.  Is this related perhaps to the default xml having python2.7 in it?

   <suite-directory>/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rhcert/suites</suite-directory>
    <library-directory>/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rhcert/rhcert</library-directory>

on RHEL6, should these be python2.6?
changing /etc/rhcert.xml to refer to python2.6 instead of python2.7 resolves these problems in both the CLU and web ui.
