Under some circumstances the zlib compression library can free dynamically
allocated memory twice.  This is not a security issue on OpenBSD since the BSD
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=free&amp;sektion=3">free(3)</a>
function detects this.
There is also a kernel zlib component that may be used by pppd and IPsec.
The feasibility of attacking the kernel this way is currently unknown.<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
