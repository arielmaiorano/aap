Description of problem:
In the tripleo-heat-templates, we are assigning a value to tripleo::redis_notification::haproxy_monitor_ip in the puppet hieradata. 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
puddle-2015-06-24.1

How reproducible:
100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deploy overcloud
2.
3.

Actual results:
tripleo::redis_notification::haproxy_monitor_ip is pointing at the control plane VIP

Expected results:
tripleo::redis_notification::haproxy_monitor_ip should be pointing at the redis_vip.

Additional info:
I submitted patch https://review.openstack.org/195357 upstream to address this bug.
Per Giulio Fidente the monitor IP should actually be pointing at the controller virtual IP and not the redis_vip. Also, this isn't used when pacemaker is enabled, so it doesn't affect us.
