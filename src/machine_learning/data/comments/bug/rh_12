Description of problem:
Package is way out of date, last update to package in Fedora was nearly a year ago, upstream is up to 1.1.2 while Fedora only has 0.8.6.

PyPi:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cffi

I need the newer version to update my own packages.
So, does this mean that rawhide will be getting an update?  Soon?
