If the Postfix sendmail replacement is installed on a system an
attacker may be able to gain root privileges on the local host via
sudo(8) which runs the mailer as root with an environment inherited
from the invoking user.  While this is a bug in sudo it is not
believed to be possible to exploit when sendmail (the mailer that
ships with OpenBSD) is the mailer.  As of version 1.6.5, sudo passes
the mailer an environment that is not subject to influence from the
invoking user.<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
