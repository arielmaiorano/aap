All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7 contain a buffer management error.
It is unclear whether or not this bug is exploitable.<br>
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.3/common/004_sshbuffer.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
NOTE: this is the <em>second</em> revision of the patch that fixes an additional
problem.
