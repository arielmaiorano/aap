Additional info: /var/log/ from the host
When connecting to original host
systemctl restart vdsmd - doesnt start vdsm
even after rhevh reboot.

Cant recreate locally.

Please rebuild the host again with original rhevh (the one with the bug 20150609.0.el7ev)

please use firstboot=1
A lot of informations are lacking: Is this bug during installation of RHEV-H or while setting up hosted-engine? What installation method? At what point did the installation stop?

Installed RHEV-H again using firstboot=1 and the service still cannot be started

Not related to hosted-engine specifically, the service cannot be started manually with systemctl.

It is okay that vdsmd does not start after RHEV-H installation.
The only important point is that vdsmd is running correct after registration or beeing added to a RHEV-M.

Elad, does adding the host to RHEV-M work and can you launch a VM on the RHEV-H host after registration?

If both of this works, then we can close this bug.
Lowering the priority because we did not - yet - see this problem elsewhere.
Test version:
rhev-hypervisor7-7.1-20150609.0.el6ev
ovirt-node-3.2.3-3.el7.noarch
ovirt-node-plugin-hosted-engine-0.2.0-15.0.el7ev.noarch
vdsm-4.16.20-1.el7ev.x86_64

Test steps:
1. TUI install RHEV-H7.1 build.
2. Login the hypervisor and check vdsmd service.
3. Configure network and check vdsmd service.
4. Register to RHEVM and check vdsmd service again.

Test result:
1. After step 2, vdsmd status show as active.

2. After step 3, vdsmd status show as inactive.

Thanks for testing Elad, so it looks liek the original problem was related to an environmental issue.

Closing this bug according to comment 8.
Fabian, I encountered the following issue in the post rhevm installation phase during the HE deployment:
