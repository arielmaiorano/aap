A security hole exists in <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=uuxqt&amp;sektion=8">uuxqt(8)</a>
that may allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands as user uucp and
use this to gain root access.
The UUCP execution daemon, uuxqt(8), has a bug in its command line
parsing routine that may allow arbitrary commands to be run.  Because
some UUCP commands are run as root (and daemon) from cron it is possible
to leverage compromise of the UUCP user to gain root.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
