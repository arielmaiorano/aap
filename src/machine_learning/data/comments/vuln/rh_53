Description of problem:
I'm doing a deployment with 3 controllers, 1 compute and 1 ceph node on baremetal with network isolation. During the deployment there are large periods when the overcloud nodes don't output anything in os-collect-config log. Also the heat-engine log seems to be showing the same things in loop. Note that this happens only when introducing the ceph node. Deployment with 1 controller, 1 compute, 3 controllers, 1 compute went ok. 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
instack-undercloud-2.1.2-6.el7ost.noarch
openstack-tripleo-common-0.0.1.dev6-0.git49b57eb.el7ost.noarch
openstack-tripleo-puppet-elements-0.0.1-2.el7ost.noarch
openstack-tripleo-0.0.7-0.1.1664e566.el7ost.noarch
openstack-tripleo-image-elements-0.9.6-4.el7ost.noarch
openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-0.8.6-22.el7ost.noarch

How reproducible:
50%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deploy a 3 controller, 1 compute and 1 ceph node with network isolation
2. 
3.

Actual results:
Deployment doesn't show any progress, overcloud nodes don't show any activity in os-collect-config. 

Expected results:
Deployment would be successful.

Additional info:
Attaching part of the heat-engine.log.

Can you clarify what output you see when you deploy the cloud? Does anything start to build?

What was in your network-environment.yaml file?

I have seen an issue where CephStorageNodesPostDeployment would time out when network isolation was enabled, but the Heat resources would all go into CREATE_COMPLETE except for Ceph. Not sure if that's related. That's this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1236167
Yes, it start to build, the nodes boot up, I can log in via ssh and watch the os-collect-config logs. At the end deployment fails with this  message.

This appears to be due to the keystone timeout issue.  Marking a duplicate
