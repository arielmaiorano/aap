An incorrectly formatted ClientHello handshake message could cause
OpenSSL to parse past the end of the message.  An attacker could use this flaw
to trigger an invalid memory access, causing a crash of an application linked
to OpenSSL.  As well, certain applications may expose the contents of parsed
OCSP extensions, specifically the OCSP nonce extension.
