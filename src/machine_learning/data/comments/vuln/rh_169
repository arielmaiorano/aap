Description of problem:
**************************************
While running the test on PTM (protocol test manager)which is to test whether server can handle per share encryption correctly.

The test fails with the error message that "Server should set SMB2_SHAREFLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA for share flags in TREE_CONNECT response"

The settings are default as follows:
1.max protocol = smb3
2.smb encrypt = default (global)

When max protocol is set to SMB3 , the global option for smb encrypt is set to default(auto) which means if client requires encrypted session the server is capable of SMB encryption.

The expectation is same for smb encrypt for all the shares of this server.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
samba-4.1.17-7.el6rhs.x86_64.rpm


How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.2X2 volume accessed by windows as a samba share
2.Verify if max protocol is set to SMB3
3.Verify the value of smb encrypt for global
4.Run the test from PTM to verify if the server can handle per share encryption correctly.
5.Verify the results.

Actual results:
************************************
The test fails with the error message that "Server should set SMB2_SHAREFLAG_ENCRYPT_DATA for share flags in TREE_CONNECT response"

Expected results:
*************************************
When the smb encrypt flag is set globally as default(auto) , the share flags should also be set appropriately so if a session request comes from a client which is capable of smb encryption the share should also have that capability as server unless it is set locally to a different value.


Additional info:
The results with smb encrypt = auto and smb encrypt = enabled is same as above.

Also we need smb.conf man page to be updated with latest settings for smb encrypt.
Sorry for the confusion:
There are several bug related to SMB3 encryption.
In comment #5 I did in fact propose to close this one as NOTABUG,
because the default setting does actually work as expected.

Instead bug #1237085 and #1237063 are the important ones to get.

==> Closing this one now.

Apologies for the confusion!
