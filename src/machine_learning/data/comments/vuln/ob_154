Under certain conditions, on systems using YP with netgroups in the
password database, it is possible that
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;sektion=8">sshd(8)</a>
does ACL checks for the requested user name but uses the password
database entry of a different user for authentication.  This means
that denied users might authenticate successfully while permitted
users could be locked out.<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
