Since this issue was entered in Red Hat Bugzilla, the release flag has been
set to ? to ensure that it is properly evaluated for this release.
Closing bug as Marcello found out, the issue was caused due to manifest issue.

I was able to double check my account that was using another employee sku.

It seemed that even though the Satellite allows the ability to tick the subscriptions, it needs to be double checked through the manifest certificate.

Closing this case and creating a kcs to help future cases.
