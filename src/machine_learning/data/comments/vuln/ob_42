xlockmore has a localhost attack against it which allows recovery of the encrypted
hash of the root password.  The damage to systems using DES passwords from this
attack is pretty heavy, but to systems with a well-chosen root password under
blowfish encoding
(see <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crypt&amp;sektion=3">
crypt(3)</a>)
the impact is much reduced.<br>
(Aside:  We do not consider this a localhost root hole in the default install,
since we have not seen a fast blowfish cracker yet ;-)<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
This is the 2nd patch designed to solve this problem.
