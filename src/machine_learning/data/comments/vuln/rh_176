Description of problem:
Deploying on bare metals with the poodle from June 17th. Installed with the unified cli and deployed with the command:

openstack overcloud deploy --plan-uuid 03e68e5a-c5c3-4706-b71c-fd8128112b8a --ceph-storage-scale 1 --control-scale 3 --compute-scale 3

Many nodes failed to create:

Steps to Reproduce:
1. openstack overcloud deploy --plan-uuid 03e68e5a-c5c3-4706-b71c-fd8128112b8a --ceph-storage-scale 1 --control-scale 3 --compute-scale 3


Additional info:
The images were built by Marius Cornea and they're known to be good.
Also failed when trying to deploy with 1 compute and no ceph (only 3 controllers). Deployment with 1 controller passed, so there is a problem with HA. Marking this bug as a blocker.
Udi, to be clear, this is not reproducible on vm environment (bare-metal only right?). I haven't tried Ceph yet but yesterday was deploying 3 controllers ok

if that is the case and since i cannot reproduce can you dig a bit more to find out what went wrong (journalctl -n 1000000 | grep -ni error on any of the controllers would be nice, assuming they're running etc).
