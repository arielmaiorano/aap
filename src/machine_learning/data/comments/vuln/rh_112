2.submit jobs in hlk


Actual results:
following jobs failed
HyperVisor Code Integrity Readiness Test - we didn't meet this job in win10 build 9926 105-balloon whql test 
Device Driver INF Verification Test - job passed during win10 build 9926 105-balloon whql test 

Expected results:
jobs can pass

Additional info:
1.we have run 105 balloon whql test with windows 10 build **9926** before,all jobs passed.
2.Try on windows 10 build **10130**,still failed
3.Please check the attached hlk log
1.Job "Device Driver INF Verification Test" should pass after download the latest errata filter according to http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windows_hardware_certification/archive/2015/05/19/hlk-compatibility-program-playlist-update.aspx,I will try it tmr due to the network issue.

2.If I use playlist from https://sysdev.microsoft.com/en-US/Hardware/compatibilityplaylists/,the total job amount will reduce from 49 to 15.
job "HyperVisor Code Integrity Readiness Test" will be removed.
following is my questions:
Is it necessary to fix this issue when it's not in the playlist?
Is that ok if we submit with playlist loaded?We still can get the same certification,right?
Can we self-define the playlist and submit result to msft?
Job "Device Driver INF Verification Test" passed after update the latest filter
Hi Li,

Are you using playlists? I think "HyperVisor Code Integrity Readiness Test" should be excluded when using playlist.

Thanks,
Yan.

Sorry missed commend #2.

For certification we should pass only the tests that are defined in playlist.

For internal testing we should run all the tests - but "HyperVisor Code Integrity Readiness Test" should be investigated more (it uses MS hypervisor capabilities during the test, not sure it can even run in VM).

We can close this BZ.
