Description of problem:
In rhcert-default.xml the bugzilla and catalog url are pointing to stage instance instead of production.

<catalog-url search-retries="3" search-timeout="10">https://partner-hwcert.redhat.com/xmlrpc.cgi</catalog-url>
    <bugzilla-url>https://partner-bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi</bugzilla-url>

This is high priority and needs to be fixed urgently

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
redhat-certification-1.0-20150622.el7.noarch

How reproducible:
Everytime

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install redhat-certification
2. Open rhcert-default.xml and check the catalog-url and bugzilla-url
3. They are not pointing to production instance.

Actual results:
rhcert.xml pointing to partner bugzilla and CWE instance

Expected results:
rhcert.xml should be pointing to production
Openstack partners are unable to submit logs, can we fix this and we need to update errata for the latest content.
