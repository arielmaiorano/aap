Description of problem:
dnssec-trigger-script checks NetworkManager configuration, which is located in /etc/NetworkManager/ to determine, if NM is handling the /etc/resolv.conf. Thus dnssec-trigger should be able to do that.
SELinux is preventing dnssec-trigger- from 'open' accesses on the file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf.

*****  Plugin catchall (100. confidence) suggests   **************************

If you believe that dnssec-trigger- should be allowed open access on the NetworkManager.conf file by default.
Then you should report this as a bug.
You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
Do
allow this access for now by executing:
# grep dnssec-trigger- /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M mypol
# semodule -i mypol.pp
