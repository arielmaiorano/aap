Section Number and Name: 
CHAPTER 7. UPGRADING RED HAT SATELLITE SERVER AND CAPSULE SERVER

Describe the issue: 
subscription-manager commands in upgrade procedure state incorrect repos.

subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-server-7-satellite-6.0-rpms 
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-7-satellite-6-beta-rpms


Suggestions for improvement: 

subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-7-server-satellite-6.0-rpms 
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-satellite-6-beta-rpms

Also, any other Satellite 6.0 repos that are enabled should be disabled and the corresponding Satellite 6.1 Beta repos enabled.

e.g.
rhel-7-server-satellite-optional-6.0-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-6.0-source-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-6.0-debug-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-optional-6.0-source-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-optional-6.0-debug-rpms

For a capsule:
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-6.0-debug-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-optional-6.0-debug-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-6.0-source-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-optional-6.0-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-6.0-rpms
rhel-7-server-satellite-capsule-optional-6.0-source-rpms



Additional information:
Since this issue was entered in Red Hat Bugzilla, the release flag has been
set to ? to ensure that it is properly evaluated for this release.
This seems to contradict https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233848 which states:

BAD: rhel-7-server-satellite-6-beta-rpms 
GOOD: rhel-server-7-satellite-6-beta-rpms 


Can I get a definite answer before I do any more updates?

Thanks
Sorry, my bad the above are correct.
