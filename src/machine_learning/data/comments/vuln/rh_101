Description of problem:
Having a content view (CV) with some puppet module attached: while the CV is in Library environment, CV versions of the CV show expected puppet modules in Content column.

But when promoting this CV to further environment, the Content column shows 0 Puppet Modules.

Checking the CV version via hammer shows expected Puppet module(s) attached, though.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Sat 6.0.8


How reproducible:
100%


Steps to Reproduce:
0. Create a lifecycle environment above Library one.
1. Create a product with a puppet repo with uploaded puppet module (i.e. motd)
2. Create a CV, attach some arbitrary repo (i.e. rhel 7Server or whatever is synced)
3. Add New Puppet Module to the CV
4. Publish New Version of the CV and wait until it finishes.
5. Check Content of the CV (some packages and errata per product repo attached in step 2, plus the puppet module from step 3)
6. Promote the CV to the lifecycle environment created in step 0.
7. Check Contents of the CV


Actual results:
Step 5 shows expected "1 Puppet Modules"

Step 7 shows "0 Puppet Modules"


Expected results:
Both step 5 and 7 should show "1 Puppet Modules"


Additional info:
hammer shows the CV version contains the puppet module:

    Version: 1.0.3


Interestingly, when I do some change to the CV (i.e. create any filter), create new version, the new version (in Library) has 1 Puppet Modules, while previous version with the same modules inside but in Dev has 0 Puppet Modules.
