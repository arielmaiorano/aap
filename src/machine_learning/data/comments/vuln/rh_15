Description of problem:
The default backend for Glance should be local storage (LVM). When deploying with osp-d the default is Swift for some reason. You can see it if you look in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf:

[glance_store]
stores=glance.store.swift.Store


How reproducible:
100%


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deploy an overcloud with osp-d
2. Look in a controller node in /etc/glance/glance-api.conf


Actual results:
The default backend for storage is swift


Expected results:
The default backend for storage should be "file"
The default is going to support an HA deployment. The default is going to be stores=glance.store.swift.Store
