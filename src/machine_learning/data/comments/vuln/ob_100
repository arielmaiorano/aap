A security hole exists in <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=lpd&amp;sektion=8">lpd(8)</a>
that may allow an attacker with line printer access to gain root
privileges.  A machine must be running lpd to be vulnerable (OpenBSD
does not start lpd by default).  Only machines with line printer
access (ie: listed in either /etc/hosts.lpd or /etc/hosts.equiv)
may be used to mount an attack.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
