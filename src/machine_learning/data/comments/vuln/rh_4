Moving to vdsm, looks like a duplicate of bug #1235591.

Ying, does this bug go away when you start he-setup again?

As far as I can tell this can't be even reproduced with some reliability.
vdsm infra team tried to investigate on that and couldn't find the issue.
On hosted engine side, the tool just receive underlying errors from vdsm.
If you manage to reproduce the issue in a reliable way we can try to get rid of it.

BTW since it was verified as a known issue and not as a resolved issue I don't see this as a regression.

Fabian, Yes, test he-setup again, still this issue.

No, still existing.

NOTE:
I run hosted-engine --deploy on console still got failed.

This log is unrelated to the issue reported:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Here there's a connection error to the storage.
Ying, according to comment 12 this can be an issue with the used storage. What kind of storage are you using and could there be networking problems?
