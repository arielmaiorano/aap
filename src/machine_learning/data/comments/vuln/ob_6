If the sysctl variable <strong>net.inet.ip.forwarding</strong> is
enabled (value 1), but the variable <strong>net.inet.ip.sourceroute</strong>
is disabled (value 0), the kernel will block source routed packets from
going through, but will still accept source routing packets destined for
itself.  Our fix changes the <strong>net.inet.ip.sourceroute</strong>
variable semantics to mean that all source routed packets should
be blocked completely.
