Description of problem:
I created a Rails4 application using console.itos.redhat.com but apart from viewing files in public folder (index.html) it does not allow for any app building of any soryt. 
If I add a custom controller and a view for the controller, uncomment the root statement in config.rb to point to the controller and action, and finally rename public/index.html - this reports a rails error. See steps below.

Moreover, the SAME STEPS on openshift.redhat.com produces a working app. i.e. I can build rails apps on openshift.redhat.com but NOT via console.itos.redhat.com

This has been a persistent problem with console.itos - I have yet to create a functioning rails app using it unless I do everything in the public folder which defeats the purpose of creating an app.

I looked into the ruby log file and it may be Phusion passenger related. But please

How reproducible:


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a rails 4 app
2. create a file called graphs_controller.rb in app/controller/folder. paste this code in it:
class GraphsController < ApplicationController
	def home
		render "index"
	end
end
3. Create a directory in app/views called graphs
In that add an index.html file with contents "Hello World"
4. Uncomment #root 'welcome#index' in config/routes.rb to: 
root graphs#home
5. rename public/index.html to public/index_defunct.html
6. git add . at the app root.
7. git add -u public/index.html
8. git push

Now go to the URL 

Actual results:
Rails error "we're sorry but something went wrong..." message

Expected results:
It should show me contents of app/views/graphs/index.html. it does not do it when creating an app using the above steps from console.itos.redhat.com but does so when creating the rubyonrails4 app using openshift.redhat.com
