Description of problem:

dnf (or the fedora repositories) or installation process appears to be enabling updates-testing without reason. This has caused several packages to install from updates testing. This has happened on two systems that I have tried to rebuild this week. 

Note that until I had problems with the installations (dependancies/bugs) I had not enabled the updates-testing repos. 

Example packages picked up are:

mesa-filesystem-10.6.0-1.fc22.x86_64
NetworkManager-1:1.0.4-0.1.git20150618.8cffaf3bf5.fc22

using 

dnf downgrade NetworkManager*

result in:

No match for available package: NetworkManager-1:1.0.2-1.fc22.x86_64
No match for available package: NetworkManager-adsl-1:1.0.2-1.fc22.x86_64
...

If I use yum-deprecated then at least the downgrade offers the correct packages to downgrade. Therefore I suspect in the first instance a dnf problem but it is just speculation. 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

dnf 1.0.1-2.fc22 (could have been earlier if this is not the release level)

How reproducible:

Very difficult

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Fedora 22 on system from live CD
2. Update software using "dnf update -y"
3. Install new software using "dnf install -y ..."

Actual results:

Dependency nightmares, bugs and test versions all over the place.


Expected results:

The karma of a nice Fedora 22 system.

Additional info:
Hello Paul,

# dnf repolist

will tell you what repositories are enabled.

# dnf distro-sync

should replace testing packages with the ones from enabled repos.

You can also try

# dnf history list mesa-filesystem

to see the transaction which installed testing mesa-filesystem package.
(Assuming it was installed via dnf.)
Also

# dnf info mesa-filesystem

will tell you from which repository it was installed (again assuming that it was installed via DNF).

(BTW, I've followed the reproducer but it didn't happen to me.)
Closing as we are not able to reproduce it. Paul, if it still happens to you, reopen and post the output of this sequence, please:
# dnf repolist
# dnf install/update/downgrade <pkgname>
# dnf info <pkgname>
