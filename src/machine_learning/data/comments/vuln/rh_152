Description of problem:
Instack-deploy-overcloud isn't using the OVERCLOUD_EXTRA environment variable setting as part of its final heat-stack-create command, so we are unable to pass in values for additional parameters. 

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
OSP-D Beta 1

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a neutron_env.yaml file with a value for a parameter to be set.  
2. Run- `export OVERCLOUD_EXTRA="-e /home/stack/neutron_env.yaml $OVERCLOUD_EXTRA"` or `export OVERCLOUD_EXTRA="$OVERCLOUD_EXTRA -e /home/stack/neutron_env.yaml "` 
3. Run instack-deploy-overcloud

Actual results:
The OVERCLOUD_EXTRA file doesn't appear on the heat-stack-create command line and the passed in value for the parameter isn't set in the final deployment.

Expected results:
Heat-stack-create should include the OVERCLOUD_EXTRA file and the parameter should be properly set in the deployment.

Additional info:
N/A
I think this needs to be a CLI command and is related to bug 1235000 which changes how the extra config stuff works.  

@trown:  any thoughts?
Yes, instack-deploy-overcloud is deprecated at this point. The way this will work with the unified cli, using the given example, is:

openstack overcloud deploy --use-tripleo-heat-templates -e /home/stack/neutron_env.yaml

This functionality has not yet made it to the beta yet though.
The documentation for beta 2 should contain the right steps to follow.  If not, please re-open
