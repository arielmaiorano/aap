Kernel contained an undocumented system call used to lock semaphore operations
while they were being sampled by the ipcs(1) command.  This locking could be
used as a local denial of service attack which would block the exiting of
processes which had semaphore resources allocated. Processes not using
semaphores are not affected, so the actual effect is very minimal.<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
