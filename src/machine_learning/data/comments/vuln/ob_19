A possible new security problem exists if you rely on securelevels and
immutable or append-only files or character devices.  The fix does not
permit mmap'ing of immutable or append-only files which are otherwise
writable, as the VM system will bypass the meaning of the file flags
when writes happen to the file.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
