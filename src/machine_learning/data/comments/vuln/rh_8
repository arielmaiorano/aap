Description of problem:

Setup: 2 Monitors/Screens Nvidia GT640 with RPMFusion nvidia drivers
CPU: AMD FX-8350 4 GHZ 8 GB RAM

Since I upgraded  from F20 to F21 3 days ago, if i move a window from 
the one monitor to the other monitor, the cpu load for gnome-shell increase heavyly to a point, where the entire move operation seems to standstill, than it "jumps" to the actual mouse position. The Jump takes app. 1 sec.
To be precise, the mouse pointer moves normally, it's the window that does not follow on spot and than jumps after the mounse pointer. When the jump happend, it moves normally.

As far as i move it inside a monitor, it's fine. But it starts, when the mouse pointer crosses the border! If the window border crosses the monitor border while just moving aroun inside one monitor, nothing bad happens at all. 

If the mouse crosses the border, but is not dragging a window, nothing bad  happens. The mouse just moves around uninterrupted.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

gnome-shell.x86_64                                        3.14.4-2.fc21  

Steps to Reproduce:
1. two monitors
2. one window
3. move it from left to right or vice versa.

Additional info:

it looks like the switch from one side to another side of the monitor/screen border takes so much cpu time, that it's visible.
UPDATE: 

After rebooting, problems have gone.
