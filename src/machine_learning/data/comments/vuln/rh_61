Description of problem:

In attempting to install everything from a group I found that "dnf group install <group-spec>" was not working as expected. I was directed to "dnf groupinstall <group-spec>" which did work. Looking for "groupinstall" in the dnf man page I found that it was missing. I'm wondering what else is missing. Perhaps a simple pointer to more elaborate/detailed information about DNF in the dnf man page would be useful?

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
dnf-1.0.1-2.fc22.noarch


How reproducible:

Additional info:
"groupinstall" is an undocumented alias for "group install". And I don't think that we want to document it. I guess that the problem was somewhere else.

Radek,

I don't understand why "group install" and "groupinstall" behave differently.

I'm interested in installing all of several groups the "group install" appears to just "mark" the group as installed whereas "groupinstall" appears to go ahead and do the actual installs.

My confusion is almost complete now.

Thanks,

George...
George, as described in the e-mail, the key is the "with-optional" argument.

"dnf group install with-optional @Group" and
"dnf groupinstall with-optional @Group" (don't use it)
behaves the same

"dnf group install @Group" and
"dnf groupinstall with-optional @Group"
doesn't

"dnf group install with-optional @Group" and
"dnf groupinstall @Group"
doesn't as well

Just forget the "groupinstall" command and learn the "with-optional" argument.
groupinstall command "does not exist" in DNF -> group install should be used.
Radek/Jan,

Ok. I'll write it a 1000 times on the wall... 

Thanks for your patience,

George...
