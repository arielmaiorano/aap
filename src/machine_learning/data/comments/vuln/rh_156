Description of problem:
CBFlib-devel does not require hdf5-devel

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
rawhide

How reproducible:
Install CBFlib-devel via dnf or rpm.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. dnf install CBFlib-devel

Actual results:
CBFlib-devel installed along with CBFlib.

Expected results:
CBFlib-devel will be install with CBFlib AND with hdf5-devel.


Additional info:
1. Any package required CBFlib can't be build as cbflib headers require hdf5 headers.
2. There is mass rebuild in rawhide at this moment.
Taking as obvious. I'll add "R: hdf5-devel" to CBFlib-devel
Fixed in rawhide: http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=10177145

However, AFAIS, this problem also affects older Fedoras, where it 
also should be fixed - Timm?

Not SO obvious. In older Fedora CBFlib-devel does require hdf5-devel. Somehow.

Anyway, thanks.

I disagree - VERY obvious:

- CBFlib-devel includes /usr/include/hdf5.h:
  cbf_hdf5.h:#include <hdf5.h>

- libcbf.so is linked against libhdf5.so:
  # ldd usr/lib64/libcbf.so
    ...
	libhdf5.so.10 => not found
    ...

- There are packages, which FTBFS due to this missing dep in the recent mass rebuilt.
Resolved.
