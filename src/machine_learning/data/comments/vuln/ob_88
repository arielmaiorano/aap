Two problems have recently been discovered in the KerberosIV code.<p>
1. A symlink problem was discovered in the KerberosIV password checking
routines /usr/bin/su and /usr/bin/login, which makes it possible for a
local user to overwrite any file on the local machine.<p>
2. It is possible to specify environment variables in telnet
which will be passed over the to the remote host. This makes it
possible to set environment variables on the remote side, including
ones that have special meaning on the server. It is not clear at this
time what the impact is, but we recommend everyone to upgrade their
machines immediately.<p>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
