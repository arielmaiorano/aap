Programs using the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fts&amp;sektion=3&amp;format=html">fts(3)</a>
routines (such as rm, find, and most programs that take a <b>-R</b>
flag) can be tricked into changing into the wrong directory if the
parent dir is changed out from underneath it.  This is similar to
the old fts bug but happens when popping out of directories, as
opposed to descending into them.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.8/common/029_fts.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
This is the second version of the patch.
