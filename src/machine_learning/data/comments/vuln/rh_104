Description of problem:
**************************************
CTDB nodes not coming to healthy state after starting ctdb service.
SELinux is set to enforcing.

type=AVC msg=audit(06/25/2015 02:45:46.844:2625) : avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=22921 comm=net name=ctdbd.socket dev=dm-0 ino=1443389 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:samba_net_t:s0 tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:var_run_t:s0 tclass=sock_file 

If we check the context for socket file :
srwx------. root root unconfined_u:object_r:var_run_t:s0 /var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket

after running restorecon -R -v /var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket we are again getting the correct context..

After analysis and debugging from development team it looks like the ctdb context has to be set on /usr/sbin/ctdbd_wrapper because this is creating the /var/run/ctdb directory and it will apply the context on the contents of this directory.
When we tried to set the context for /usr/sbin/ctdbd_wrapper , remove /var/run/ctdb and then start ctdb service it works fine.

so we need same attributes to be set for /usr/sbin/ctdbd_wrapper as it is done for /usr/sbin/ctdbd.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
rpm -qa | grep ctdb
ctdb2.5-2.5.5-2.el6rhs.x86_64


How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install RHEL6.7 , latest gluster rpms, latest samba and ctdb rpms
2. Do ctdb setup
3. Start ctdb service 

Actual results:
CTDB fails to start smb service and remains in UNHEALTHY state.

Expected results:
CTDB should be able to start smb service and should come to HEALTHY state.

It would be better when the /var/run/ctdb directory was part of ctdb RPM package. The directory would be labeled correctly during the package installation. The ctdbd.socket file in /var/run/ctdb directory would inherit its label from the directory, which is default behavior.
This is not selinux-policy bug.
