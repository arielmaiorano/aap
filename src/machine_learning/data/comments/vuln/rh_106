Description of problem:

In Backups, the Overview tab says “You can restore the entire backup with the Restore... button or use Files to either revert individual files or restore missing ones.”

In Files's Help, at Files » Backing up » Restore a backup, the help says:

“If you created your backup using a backup application such as Déjà Dup, it is recommended that you use the same application to restore your backup. Review the application help for your backup program: it will provide specific instructions on how to restore your files.”

This is not true. I can't find any way to restore a backup of an individual file.


Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

Files 3.16.2
Backups doesn't have an “About” dialogue; its version is “Unknown” according to Software.

How reproducible:
Every time

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a backup using Backups
2. Try to restore or revert an individual backed-up file
3.

Actual results:
Cannot

Expected results:
Can

Additional info:
I'm sure Files used to have a content menu item to allow this, but it doesn't seem to exist any more. If so, this is a regression.
This is entirely my fault. I had excluded this folder from Backups. Well done me.

There *is* a content menu option to revert a file to a previous version, but of course only if the folder has been backed up.
