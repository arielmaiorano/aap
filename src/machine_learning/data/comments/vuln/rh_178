The preprocessed source file that generated the internal compiler error

Description of problem:
I installed the latest Fedora 22 upgrades which appear to include gcc 5.1.1-3.  When I compile my library and its test programs, it generates g++ internal compiler error.  This problem did not happen before the upgrade.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
gcc 5.1.1-3

How reproducible:
The problem happens every time I compile my libraries.

Steps to Reproduce:
This is the compiler command line that was used:
g++ -ansi -c -g -o obj-fed22i32/test_cresultset.o -Wall -Werror -ftemplate-depth=1024 -m32 -I/home/Devel/projects/include -I/usr/local/boost_1_58_0/include -std=c++14  -DBOOST_ALL_NO_LIB -DBOOST_NO_AUTO_PTR -D__LINUX__ -D__32__ -D__FED__ -D__FEDI__ -D_GLIBCXX_USE_SCHED_YIELD -D_GLIBCXX_USE_NANOSLEEP -D__L_ENDIAN__ -DBOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK src/test_cresultset.cpp

Actual results:
This is the complete error message that the compile generated:
src/test_cresultset.cpp: In member function ‘void TestCResultSet::TestGetFail1::test_method()’:
src/test_cresultset.cpp:241:4: internal compiler error: in build_ctor_subob_ref, at cp/tree.c:2469
    };^M
