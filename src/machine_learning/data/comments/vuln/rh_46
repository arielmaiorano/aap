16.2. Disaster Recovery
‚Å†16.2.1. Red Hat Satellite Backup Procedure

Describe the issue:
There are official backup and restore scripts in the Katello GitHub repo which are reviewed and compared to the official RedHat recommendations for Satellite 6.0

Scripts:

https://github.com/Katello/katello/blob/master/script/backup.sh
https://github.com/Katello/katello/blob/master/script/restore.sh

RedHat Backup Guide:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Satellite/6.0/html/User_Guide/sect-Disaster_Recovery.html

The only difference in the scripts is that RedHat says to backup a directory called /etc/gofer but instead, the script backs up /etc/grinder

Would you be able to confirm why this is the case and if it is OK to use these scripts? 

Suggestions for improvement: 

Backup directory name should be .etc.grinder instead /etc/gofer/
