Description of problem:
I'm trying to build an rpm in a private rpmbuild tree but am consistently getting a fatal error;

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):


How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. this piece of script (from my builder script)

  echo ""
  echo "# Building SRPM $dstSrpmFile"
  echo "$rpmbuildDir"
  echo "$dstSpecFile"
  find "$rpmbuildDir" -type f -exec ls -la '{}' ";" | sort -k 9
  echo ""
  rpmbuild $rpmbuildQuiet -vv -D "_topdir = $rpmbuildDir" -bs "$dstSpecFile"

2. produces

The error is rather strange since the really is there and it's readable to all.

rpmbuild strace

Why is it accessing /usr/lib/rpm/init.lua?

dnf says nothing provides it
rpmdevtools package is not involved at all.


> D "_topdir = $rpmbuildDir" -

the " = " is wrong.

Next time please discuss such a problem on users@ list first.
Sorry, tunnel vision I guess.

I'm now using -D "%_topdir $rpmbuildDir" and that works fine.
