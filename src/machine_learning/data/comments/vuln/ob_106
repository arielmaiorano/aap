The signal handlers in <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8&amp;format=html">sendmail(8)</a> contain code that is unsafe in the
context of a signal handler.  This leads to potentially serious
race conditions.  At the moment this is a theoretical attack only
and can only be exploited on the local host (if at all).<br>
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.9/common/001_sendmail.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
