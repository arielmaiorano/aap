Description of problem:
ganesha-ha.sh has an option refresh--config that is essential for using changing parameters like ACL etc in the export config file. The refresh-config logic
is not present in the script as of now. This is absolutely neccessary for
customers to use security options, sub-directory export via NFS-Ganesha.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
nfs-ganesha-2.2.0-3+rhs-glusterfs 3.1


How reproducible:
Always


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute refresh--config using ganesha-ha.sh
2.
3.

Actual results:
Doesn't do anything


Expected results:
It should dynamically export and unexport the volume and thus refreshing the config of the specific volume.


Additional info:
This is an easy fix and a fix should be posted upstream by EOD today
