A problem in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isakmpd&amp;sektion=8">isakmpd(8)</a>
caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isakmpd&amp;sektion=8">isakmpd(8)</a>
was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
replay counter.

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
