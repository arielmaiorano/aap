Description of problem:
While running "openstack baremetal introspection bulk start" the fifth node seems to miss the pxe service / file which in turn causes the node to hang on "no boot device found" error. The current method of working around this issue is a reboot of the effected node which will promptly start the introspection, as long as ironic is still within its timeout window.
