A bug in the vm system permits a file descriptor opened read-only on a
device, to later on be mmap(2)'d read-write, and then modified.  This
does not result in a security hole by itself, but it does violate the
safety semantics which securelevels are supposed to provide.  If a user
manages to gain kmem group permissions, using this problem they can then
gain root trivially and/or turn securelevels off.

A kernel patch is available which corrects this behaviour (this is
revision 3 of this patch)</a>.
