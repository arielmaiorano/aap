Description of problem:
'kwrite' is missing in the 'Component' list at https://bugzilla.redhat.com for 'Product: Fedora'

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
version 4.4.9032-3

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/ with your login credentials
2. Click New [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi]
3. Select 'Product: Fedora'
4. Type 'kwrite' in 'Component:' text field 

Actual results:
kwrite is not available

Expected results:
Kwrite should be available

Additional info:
I encountered a bug with kwrite-15.04.0-1.fc22 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238611]. Since 'kwrite' was not available in the 'Component' list, thereby filed this bugzilla report.
The kwrite package is generated from the kate src.rpm which is present in the component list.

Moving to the 'Bugzilla' product which is a more appropriate place for this bug.
yep, notabug, triaging other bug against kate now.
