Milos, could you please take a look at this one and suggest a possible policy module?
This is a labeling problem on the path '/var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket'. It should be 
ctdbd_var_run_t 

To fix

 restorecon -R -v /var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket
As Simon pointed out, the /var/run/ctdb/ctdbd.socket file is mislabeled. Please run following command:

# restorecon -Rv /var/run

I'm not sure, why it happened, but let me know if the file gets mislabeled again.
I ran the following command
restorecon -Rv /var/run

and I don't see avc in audit.log either in enforcing mode or permissive.

But I had setup done exactly as per the admin guide and would want to know why the file may have been mislabeled.

I tried removing and installing the ctdb and smb packages to see if I can reproduce the error, but I could not.

Talur,

Thanks for re-testing it and providing your updates. Based on Comment 7, do you still feel it's a SELinux bug? If the issue is in ctdb and needs a fix, then I think we can move the product and component of this BZ appropriately.
tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:var_run_t:s0 tclass=sock_file

tell us it has been created by a process with unconfined_u. So either by gluster started by hand or by a script. Any chance it is a test issue? If not we need to find out where it is created and add restorecon calling in RHEL6.

I would move this bug to another component. We are not able to fix it in selinux-policy.
I tried following on fresh setup:

Install RHEL6.7
Install latest glusterfs package 
Install samba and ctdb packages

CTDB setup according to Admin guide.start ctdb service.

No AVC's logged for smb or ctdb.

The issue is not seen anymore.

Selinux packages:
selinux-policy-3.7.19-278.el6.noarch
selinux-policy-targeted-3.7.19-278.el6.noarch

Thanks Surabhi, for testing and confirming the same.

Based on the above comment, I'm taking away this BZ from the SELinux tracker. Please consider closing this BZ as well since the issue doesn't exists anymore.
