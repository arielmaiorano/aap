Additional info:
Could create app in cli :
$  oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex -n pro2
imagestreams/nodejs-ex
buildconfigs/nodejs-ex
deploymentconfigs/nodejs-ex
services/nodejs-ex
A build was created - you can run `oc start-build nodejs-ex` to start it.
Service "nodejs-ex" created at 172.30.189.55 with port mappings 8080.
I can reproduce.
URL is missing the `console` path segment.

Checked on devenv_fedora_1896, the issue has been fixed. Creating app from source code using image succeeds. So move it to Verified.
