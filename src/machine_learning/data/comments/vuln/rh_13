Description of problem:

When using the autopart command option --fstype, anaconda fails with "no such option"

This is supported by the ks failing validation when using ksvalidator.

Documentation here:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html-single/Installation_Guide/index.html#sect-kickstart-commands

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
anaconda 19.31.123-1
pykickstart-1.99.43.17-1

How reproducible:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new kickstart script
2. include autopart --fstype=<any valid>
3. kickstart new machine

Actual results:

anaconda fails, installation dies

Expected results:

anaconda automatically partitions using the specified fstype

Additional info:

While not blocking as fstype works when manually partitioning, it is a documented option that simply does not work.
Please attach the logs from /tmp/*log to this bug as individual text/plain attachments. 'autopart --fstype=ext4' works just fine in my tests.

I think I've narrowed the problem.

When running ksvalidator the default in RHEL7.0 uses the F20 validation (the same as 'ksvalidate -v F20 /source/ks.cfg' which produces this error:


The following problem occurred on line 20 of the kickstart file:

no such option: --fstype

but if I force it to use RHEL7 validation (ksvalidate -v RHEL7 /source/ks.cfg), it works fine and produces no error.

However, the installation using the ks file fails because of the error in the validation.

Attached are all logs requested, a screenshot, and the ks.cfg I used to test.
I think I see the problem now, you're using RHEL7.0 which is anaconda-19.31.79-1 and autopart --fstype was added in RHEL7.1 in anaconda-19.31.81-1 so you need to use 7.1 or later.
Perhaps the correct action then should be to add a note to the documentation that the --fstype option requires RHEL7.1 ?

Certainly it might be the easiest/most straightforward.
