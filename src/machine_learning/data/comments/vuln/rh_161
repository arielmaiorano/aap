Hi,

  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/vdsm/SecureXMLRPCServer.py", line 92, in connect
    sock = socket.create_connection((self.host, self.port), self.timeout)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/socket.py", line 553, in create_connection
    for res in getaddrinfo(host, port, 0, SOCK_STREAM):

looks like you've network issues on your host. It can't connect to localhost.
