Description of problem: Second monitor does not work with F22.  The same system works fine with F21.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):


How reproducible: Always reproducible.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot the system
2.
3.

Actual results: Second monitor does not work.

Expected results: System should boot up and both monitors connected should be active.

Additional info:

I'm running an HP Folio 9480m with an HP ZDisplay monitor connected to one of the DisplayPort connectors on the docking station.

I have F21 on a USB flash drive and if I boot from that then the second monitor is detected and works.
Re-installed Fedora 22 and now it works.  It's a mystery.
