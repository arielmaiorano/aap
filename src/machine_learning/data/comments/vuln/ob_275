A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
malformed MIME message exists.
