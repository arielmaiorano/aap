caja-1.8.2-4.fc21.x86_64

How reproducible:

1. Attach external drive; window opens on desktop.
2. Close this window.
3. Double-click the disk's icon.
4. caja crashes and restarts.

Actual results:

As above.

Expected results:

New window should open showing disk's contents.

Additional info:

This message appears in /var/log/messages:

systemd: Failed at step EXEC spawning /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon: No such file or directory

Installing a symbolic link

/usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon -> /usr/libexec/udisks-daemon

is an effective workaround.  Perhaps caja is using an outdated interface to systemd.
Confirmed with udisks-1.0.5-1.fc21.
Downgrade to udisks-1.0.4-15.fc21.x86_64 and the issue is gone.
But that's not the only issue with new udisk version.
Here caja becomes unusable.

OK, I removed the symlink /usr/lib/udisks/udisks-daemon -> /usr/libexec/udisks-daemon and installed udisks-1.0.5-2 per above.  Issue resolved, thanks.
