This looks like a Horizon issue (not related to the installer).
This sounds like something we fixed already.

Could you please report back the version of horizon?

rpm -q openstack-dashbboard

Make sure, you're using at least python-django-horizon-2015.1.0-9.el7ost
Thank you.
These are the rpms that were installed:

python-django-horizon-2015.1.0-7.el7.noarch
openstack-dashboard-2015.1.0-7.el7.noarch
