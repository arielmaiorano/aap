A security issue exists in the lpd daemon that may allow an attacker
to create arbitrary new files in the root directory.  Only machines
with line printer access (ie: listed in either /etc/hosts.lpd or
/etc/hosts.equiv) may be used to mount an attack and the attacker
must have root access on the machine.  OpenBSD does not start lpd
in the default installation.<br>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
