The ELF
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ld.so&amp;sektion=1">ld.so(1)</a>
fails to properly sanitize the environment. There is a potential localhost security
problem in cases we have not found yet.  This patch applies to all ELF-based
systems (m68k, m88k, and vax are a.out-based systems).
