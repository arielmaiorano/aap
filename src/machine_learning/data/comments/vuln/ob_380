Multiple issues in tar/pax/cpio:
<ul>
<li>extracting a malicious archive could create files outside of
the current directory without using pre-existing symlinks to 'escape',
and could change the timestamps and modes on preexisting files
<li>tar without -P would permit extraction of paths with ".." components
<li>there was a buffer overflow in the handling of pax extension headers
</ul>

A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
