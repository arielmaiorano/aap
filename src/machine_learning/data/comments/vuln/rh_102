Eli, what changed?
It probably got broken there: 
https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/42655/

In the upgrade procedure the user directly installs an upgraded version on the setup rpms only, the others are protected by versionlock and got updated by engine-setup after having updated the DB structure.

The issue here is that everything under packaging/dbscripts folder will got packed in engine-dbscripts rpm which is under versionlock while everything under packaging/setup/dbutils/ will got in the setup rpm.

Cause the the DeleteAllCommandsWithZombieTasks is needed to clean up the zombie table before upgrading (and so also before installing the new RPMs) moving it to dbscripts is not really a good idea otherwise it will not be available at setup time.

Eli, could you please revert?

I had discussed that with Didi and he will handle on SUN what is needed to make  it working
Thanks Eli, moving on Didi.
(In reply to Simone Tiraboschi from comment #2)
patch will be reverted soon since a fix for that requires a change in dbscripts which is locked
*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 1080542 ***
This was bug was already fixed in master branch, but broken in the second alpha build (ovirt-3.6.0-3, git hash 6f063c1).

A workaround, needed for upgrading to the broken version:

su -

. /usr/share/ovirt-engine/bin/engine-prolog.sh
export PGPASSWORD="${ENGINE_DB_PASSWORD}"

cd /usr/share/ovirt-engine/dbscripts

for f in fkvalidator_sp.sql taskcleaner_sp.sql; do psql -U "${ENGINE_DB_USER}" -h localhost -d "${ENGINE_DB_DATABASE}" < $f; done
Correction to the above:

su -

. /usr/share/ovirt-engine/bin/engine-prolog.sh
export PGPASSWORD="${ENGINE_DB_PASSWORD}"

cd /tmp
