Vulnerabilities have been found in the X11, Xt, Xaw and Xmu
libraries. These affect xterm and all other setuid-root programs that
use these libraries. The problems are associated with buffer overflows
in code that processes user-supplied data. The Xt library problems
include those fixed in TOG's recent public patch 3 for X11R6.3. All
releases of XFree86 up to and including 3.3.2 patch 1 and the version
distributed with OpenBSD are vulnerable to some or all of these
problems.
These problems are fixed in XFree86 patch 2.
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.3/common/XFree86-3.3.2.2.patch">
The 2nd source patch</a> for these problems, specifically adapted to the
OpenBSD 2.3 X11 tree, is available now.
