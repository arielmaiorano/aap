Description of problem:
Without me changing anything, a few days ago, authentication requests started to pop up when I'm logged in. After checking journal I found out, that abrt-applet apparently does not have access to some directory ABRT created. I think it is unexpected to have to authenticate myself in random situations, because ABRT applet is not able to do something.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
abrt-2.5.1-3.fc22.2.x86_64

How reproducible:
multiple times a day

Steps to Reproduce:
not sure, but I can provide further information

Actual results:
authentication requests from polkit in random situations, due to abrt-applet

Expected results:
NO authentication requests from polkit what so ever, due to abrt-applet

Additional info:
This is pretty annoying. Although I like ABRT and I'm using it a lot, I'm considering turning it off / remove it.

Output from log:

Thank you for taking time to report this issue.
Your problem is caused by the fact that you are using a combination of abrt 2.5.1 and libreport 2.6.0 which don't work well together due to security related changes. Please update abrt* packages to version 2.6.0.
