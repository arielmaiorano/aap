following info is reported by pchavan@redhat.com through https://engineering.redhat.com/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=358216:

<snip>
While accessing the following link without login, we get the Access Denied Message instead of a Menu with First link to "New Hardware Catalog" And second link to "Old Catalog with Login" 

[1] https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1210662 

Try accessing this link above. And then see the access denied message. 

Working link for example is as follows. 

[2] https://hardware.redhat.com/show.cgi?id=1159178 

This gives us the Menu. We need to have such menu for [1] . 

Note: [2] is given only for reference. There is nothing to do with [2]

Hi Chavan,

This is fixed.

Now [1] has the guide links for public access.
