Proxy Error

The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
The proxy server could not handle the request GET /phpmyadmin/.

Reason: Error reading from remote server

Apache/2.2.15 (Red Hat) Server at ga-nprogram.rhcloud.com Port 443
Status:	Connecting to ga-nprogram.rhcloud.com...
Response:	fzSftp started

is the database otherwise accessible?  

have you attempted to restart either phpmyadmin or the mysql server?
I've attempted the application restart.
Now the system is returned ok. I really can't understand what's happened.
