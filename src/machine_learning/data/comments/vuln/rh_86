Description of problem:

Koji build kexec-tools in rawhide create a wrong binary with extra cflags. Local build is ok.

It should be koji build system problem, I found it adds -fexceptions and
-fstack-protetor-strong, the cmdline is like below (copied from a test build log):

gcc -O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Werror=format-security -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong
--param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches -specs=/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1 -m64 -mtune=generic
-fno-strict-aliasing -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fno-zero-initialized-in-bss -mcmodel=small -Os -fno-builtin -ffreestanding
-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss -fno-PIC -fno-PIE -fno-stack-protector -fno-exceptions -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
-mcmodel=small -I./purgatory/include -I./purgatory/arch/x86_64/include -I./util_lib/include -I./include -Iinclude
-I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/5.1.1/include  -c -MD -o purgatory/purgatory.o purgatory/purgatory.c

(-mcmodel=small is added by me for testing it does not help)
Explain a bit about purgatory build, purgatory is some code which is run in kernel space during kexec loading so some flags does not work for it like -fexceptions -fstack-protector** etc.
Do you properly have installed "redhat-rpm-config" rpm installed
when trying local build? koji build (or mock build) always make
this rpm installed, and it changes %optflags (or it is recommended
to install "fedora-packager" rpm when trying local build).

Try installing "redhat-rpm-config" rpm if not installed and then
try what
$ rpm --eval %optflags
shows.
Hi,

On my laptop, the command executed output below results:

➜  kexec-tools git:(master) ✗ rpm --eval %optflags
-O2 -g -pipe -Wall -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fexceptions -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -grecord-gcc-switches  -m64 -mtune=generic

Thanks

If you add the following line to the top of the rpm spec file it will remove all the extra hardening flags and take you back to the F-22 equivilent

%undefine _hardened_build

Peter, thanks a lot, it works for me.

Just for clarification here:

kexec-tools-2.0.9-2.fc23
------------------------
* Thu Jul 02 2015 Dave Young <dyoung@redhat.com> - 2.0.9-2
- Resolve bug 1236456, kexec load fail because koji add extra gcc flags.
- Remove -FPIC for makedumpfile since it is not necessary without harden build

koji doesn't do anything with gcc flags what so ever, they are added by rpmbuild when the redhat-rpm-config package is installed. This is part of the build root core packages. You can install it on local machines and the same will happen when using rpmbuild locally or within mock.

I checked local rpmbuild gcc flags, they are exactly same with koji used, but it is odd local build works, koji build does not.
