Systems running with procfs enabled and mounted are vulnerable
to having the stderr output of setuid processes directed onto
a pre-seeked descriptor onto the stack in their own procfs memory.<br>
Note that procfs is not mounted by default in OpenBSD.<br>
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/018_procfs.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
