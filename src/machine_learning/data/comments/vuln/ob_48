The readline library shipped with OpenBSD allows history files creation
with a permissive
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=umask&amp;sektion=2">umask(2)</a>.
This can lead to the leakage of sensitive information in applications
that use passwords and the like during user interaction (one such
application is mysql).  Additionally, if the HOME environment variable
is not set, the current working directory is used; this patch disables
the history file if HOME is not set.<br>
<a href="http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/040_readline.patch">
A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.</a>
